What did you call this the podcasting booty call we come together for a very intense three hours don't s ee each other for six months until I text you again and say what you doing. It's exactly that alright so we' re gonna go through some of the best lessons I've learned from you over the last couple of months first one. Control freak is a word people with low standards use to describe people with high standards you'r e not a control freak you just want it done right the first time you're not anxious you care. Do not expect mediocre people to support world class goals. I think most people feel really lonely when you want som ething that doesn't currently exist and so some people call that dream some people call that goals what ever it is you're trying to pull something from your mind into reality. And you want it done a certain way and if it's not done that way it's not what you imagined and so people on the outside will throw stones a nd call you names that they think will change your behavior and get you to stop. And the more I have be en the person trying to pull things into reality, the more I've tried to weather and build kind of defenses against those things so that when those stones get hold at you. By being called a control freak or by sayi ng you micromanage things or that you have incredibly high standards the answer is yes because I want i t done right the first time. Because either way we're going to if you have enough will it's going to get do ne the way that I wanted to get done regardless and it will be less painful if we just do it right the first ti me because we will still have to do it and you may have to do it three or four more times. But eventually you would just come to the fact that we're going to do it this way and I think all of the great things that h ave happened for humanity have been from one man or woman who had an idea and just wouldn't let p eople shake it from them. The standard of right isn't actually that insane when you think about it it's just right it's just done without error. And I guess that the margin that some people consider to be right and other people consider to be right just changes. I'm trying to think of a really good example for this but lik e the level of detail I mean it's the difference between. It's the difference between a book that gets 10 o r 100 five-star reviews and a book that gets 100,000 five-star reviews and everyone wants a silver bullet but most of the things that make great products is a hundred golden BBs and that's one of the things we have is there's no silver bullets only hundreds of golden BBs. There's just hundreds of tiny little improve ments it's like how can we look at the can how can we improve the way it ships what about the weight what about the color scheme how does it sit on the shelves how are people going to look at it in this ma rket versus this market. Or like how does this name appear on hats and on shirts and on and on sites and what's the RGB you know whatever the color scheme scope is here versus there and it's just a thousand details that someone who does not care will not put the work to look into because they're trying to chec k a box rather than to make something that people will love or. I heard this from. I can't remember who it was from. But basically that the best art is art where the artist makes it for themselves and where you see commercial work is where a bunch of people are trying to make something for an audience. And so i t's they're trying to like rinse and recycle stuff that actually solves no one's problems because no one is a ctually the audience. Whereas when you make it for yourself there's thousands of people just like you w ho will who will have the same depth of understanding of it but it feels selfish in the moment to make so mething for yourself but when you make it for yourself you actually make it for everyone. We can be reli ably informed that there's some non insignificant minority of people who also think like you. Yes. Who al so have the same problems as you who also have the same fears as you. I'm going through two projects at the moment one being a book and the other being utonic that is nascent and it's new and that means that there's lots more of these small things that are actually quite big things. But I was telling you before we started about the fact there's a hyphen and there's a hyphen missing between one piece of copy and another piece of copy but it's printed on a million cans. But. Being concerned about being seen as someo ne who has too high standards is something that for quite a while I felt ashamed about because you feel like a bother. You feel like you're being unnecessarily it's not even detail oriented it's picky cumbersome. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I feel like I'm glorious and I realized probably last year it took me until last ye ar to realize that not succumbing to stopping doing that is probably one of the only reasons why I've had any success. I mean I think if so for anyone who's listening if you have that I would consider it a gift. It m akes sense for the majority of people to be opposed to that because you do make more work for everyo ne else. But the product of that work is so much better. And so if you want the work that you have to las t and to be meaningful and make an impact it comes from a hundred golden babies of a hundred particu larities of a hundred peculiarities that you are picky about because the whole thing needs to work. And what happens is if you have a big project lots of people have to get involved but there still needs to be o ne vision and otherwise it looks like a Frankenstein where everyone just checks a box of something they did in the past they just copy and paste it over. And then it doesn't resonate with anyone because again they just did it for everyone rather than for the artist. And so using that as a frame has given me permiss ion to be me in an unreasonable world. And so like I told I told this last time I was on but when I did the book launch I had I practiced that presentation three times a day every day for 30 days. So I did a hundre d run throughs full length run throughs first where I did it out loud and recorded it second time where I would watch the recording and then edit in real time and then do it again. And I did that every single day . And so then when I came live and had half a million people or whatever it came out I think flawlessly b ut people were like man you're such a natural at this. It's like well I did it a hundred times and so someti mes people even hear a hundred it's just a big number but when you do a hundred repetitions of somet hing the first five times you're like wow I'm so much better. But then like the difference between five an d the next 95 times is what goes from being great to being a masterpiece and like it's that next 95 that I t hink is what makes people world class and that's where everyone falls off and that's why most people ar en't. There is this pull I think from people who don't have high standards to people who do have high sta ndards to drag them back it's this like moving back toward the mean is killing the only competitive advan tage that you had. Couldn't agree more. It's. I mean it's it's conforming right it's like they. People want y ou to do what they find comfortable and most things that are like most companies deteriorate when the founder leaves because it happens slowly because it's you go to from a hundred golden babies to 99 gol den babies and it doesn't look that different and then there's 98 golden babies and they're like I don't kn ow and then two years later three years later you're like I don't know it doesn't have the same like magic as it what is what it was and that's because the art behind it isn't there because it's not unified anymore it's not completely. It's not even grown anymore it's a hundred departments making decisions with peop le copying pasting things for an audience that doesn't exist rather than one person is trying to be satisfie d for an ideal that they are trying with all their might to live up to. I suppose this is one of the important reasons to have a singular figure that is the hub and all of the spokes come off it because they're the onl y person that gets to see absolutely everything and typically that would be the founder in a podcast that would be a host in any other in a. Solo music band that would be the lead singer or the songwriter or wh atever they get to see everything. For instance we've done some episodes before where it's been the nig ht before and I've been not happy with the color grade because the way that something displays on mob ile is slightly different to the way that it displays in premiere pro and it's slightly different to the way that it displays in a 6k photographer videographers curved screen I've gone guys it's like it's not up to scratch well we're not going to be able to get it in time for the action. Export we're not going to be able to get it in time to get it uploaded and then there's checks that go through on YouTube like well. It needs to happ en I could just have making find a way to make this happen and yeah that that impulse of just actually se eing it as something that you should lean into okay well it's not and if you set the standard and if everyb ody else gets up to that standard. What it shows is the people who continually push up against that and don't meet that standard they're just not built for this particular company they're built for someone else that makes a mediocre product yeah but they're not built for you who's making a world class product an d I I really want to jam down someone's throat right now. The whole like don't be a perfectionist like you 're like it's just another word for procrastination I actually think that's complete bullshit I think that that' s a good thing. That's my quote being is it perfection is a procrastination masquerading as quality okay y es okay so that I'm gonna I'm gonna put a sub a sub a footnote on it that I think will will add context whi ch is that most people who claim to be perfectionists are not perfectionists they're actually procrastinati ng because they're not doing anything and so it just is a socially acceptable label because the real perfec tionists feel this this sickness where they like to be. Like when I itch their skin off until the things done b ut they are trying to get it done whereas the perfectionist or the procrastinator. Uses that to say like I'm not sure I'm just getting it right but like the person who's an actual perfectionist one wants to finish and is working every hour of every day on the thing and seeing progress towards it because if you don't kno w how your thing is getting better you're not a perfectionist you just ignorant. They're also moving towa rd the goal every single step of the way as opposed to just sitting back at this huge list of things that are not doing the thing planning to do the thing isn't doing the thing thinking about the thing isn't doing the thing getting angry at people on the internet that have already done the thing is doing the thing and. Th ere's also a. People who are perfectionists within the thing that matters most are prepared to see things that are ancillary to that for instance you're not absolutely a perfectionist I'm going to guess with the sh ort form content that goes out on your Instagram it's like this is sawdust as you call it this is just it's extra right it's for it's it's freebie stuff look if we have one in a hundred videos that have got a typo of the hyph ens missing or something like that. All right but if we're talking about the school announcement release i f there's a fucking typo in that or if in the video one of the links is broken or even if one of the links is slig htly pixelated. That's something that I can have a problem with picking your battles as a perfectionist I th ink actually or someone as someone with high standards is super important because you can't have that degree of high standards at absolutely everything if you don't pick your battles you're not going to make sufficient movement at the velocity you need to actually make progress so. Find the areas that are the hi ghest contribution yeah. And don't compromise on those and it's funny you say that because I the way t hat I immediately reframe that was that the perfectionism is around volume. Is like that is what we will t hat is what we are optimizing towards and then we can't because if we look at if we knew how people re sponded ahead of time to content then we would make things differently than we do but I probably like you. Am often surprised pleasantly and sometimes unpleasantly by the stuff that just grabs hold and the n just goes you know viral as hell in content and so I think part of that is making up for our own ignoranc e by increasing volume and so that would be like my reframe on the perfectionism there is like. We kno w that if we make 10 pieces of content it is more likely that we will have more people see it than if we tr y really hard at one and so we make 10 because the net benefit of the 10 is greater and so that's the ide al that we commit to. Tiago Forte has a fantastic take on this where he talks about perfectionism allows people to sit back and not produce work at a rate required to work out what actually works. Have you h eard the story of the pottery class? Oh I feel like that. Alright well. This feels like total modern wisdom. Is this where someone comes in behind and then holds the thing in front? So there is two, there is a teach er and he has got two classes that he teaches and one class he says the only assignment for this whole s emester is that you come with a come back with a perfect clay pot. That's it. That's the assignment. The other class he says your objective is to make the most total quantity of clay pots and you will be measur ed by how many pots you make. And at the end of the quarter the pots that came from the team that ha d to just make sheer volume not only did they make more pots but the quality of all of their pots was be tter compared to the teams that only had to make one. And it just underlines the biggest lesson that I've learned in my life which is that volume negates luck. Is that you can try to be lucky and pick the one perf ect thing and try and make it but if you don't want to try and be lucky you can just do so much fucking w ork that you will brute force your way to figuring it out. Like if you do a thousand podcasts you'll be prett y fucking good at podcasts. Right? But if you try to say okay you're brand new and all you have to do is m ake one perfect podcast the problem is that you don't have the perspective from which to make a judgm ent to say what is good because you have zero data to base anything off of. And so you're basing your id ea of a perfect podcast on something that you've literally never done before. And so doing the volume gi ves you the perspective to then have the best podcast at number one thousand or one thousand and on e. Anyways I just thought you'd love the clay pot. I'd know that story but I thought it was photography. S o anyway but again I don't disagree and it's finding the thing that is to try and make this tactical. What is the thing that you don't need to focus on volume today? The goal is not to try and fit ten podcasts into o ne set. It's to make this one as good as possible. But if it's shorts or reels or tweets or something it's low er leverage it's lower input. Just get it out there. Alright next one. Here's how to get older without gettin g better. Keep relearning the same lesson. If you keep making the same mistake over and over the mista ke isn't the problem. You are. So I define learning by same condition new behavior. And so when you go to a video game and you battle through the level and you battle the boss. If you keep doing the same thi ng to the boss and you keep losing then you have not learned because you have the same condition and the same behavior. And so I often say that like for anyone who's listening to this podcast if the goal is to get better and you're like man I really want to learn something from this podcast. If you listen to this po dcast and then you're in the same exact conditions as you were before and then you do not change your behavior you learned nothing. And so using that definition has at least allowed me to change my behavi or faster which then goes into rate of learning which I define as intelligence. And so a lot of people are li ke man he's so smart but he just doesn't it's like well then if he doesn't change his behavior. And he's in t he same conditions. He's a dummy. He's not that smart. And so if you were trying to battle the same bos s over and over again and you don't change what you're doing and the boss keeps beating you then it's n ot the games problem. It's your problem. You are the problem. And I think that's like if you continue I tal ked about obviously I mean I talked to a lot of entrepreneurs but I usually do this when I have a crowd. It 's like hey raise your hand if you work all the hours of the day and a lot you know most of the crowd rais ed their hand. I say okay who here has been stuck at the same revenue level for six months or more. An d then I say keep the hands up and like honestly most of the time the same hands are raised. I say you're doing the wrong shit. Like if you put all your inputs and the outputs haven't changed then you have the s ame condition and the same behavior and so you have learned nothing. And so that has always just bee n my reframe and so over time if if you're moving up in entrepreneurship you're moving up in career yo ur behavior should change because it means you've learned. Exposure to information isn't learning. Grea t deal you are. It's true. It's true and it's the same with memory. It's literally the way that memory works the best way to work out how the human memory system works is repeated recall not repeated exposur e. Right. You have to drag it out of memory and use it not just see it a million times and this is kind of the same thing with the lesson. It's you can listen to any of the podcasts that exist on the Internet or the one s that we've done or the ones that you love or whatever. And if you don't apply anything it's a waste of t ime and this is the best solution for this is Tim Ferriss is the good shit sticks look what's the thing from th e podcast or the book or the audio book or the whatever that you read or listen to that you can't stop th inking about that you go to bed and you think about it that you took a screenshot or a screen recording and send it in the group chat. That you like texted your mum about it at three in the morning. This really explains the way that I felt in school or the way that I felt when such and such broke up with me or what ever. That's the thing. That's the thing to focus on. But a lot of the time the problem with mental mastur bation is that the amount of information you can intake versus the amount of change that you can deplo y is asymmetric. Yeah. When I was getting started my entrepreneurial journey and I would say it's like pr e-op this I was when I was a entrepreneur like I hadn't quit my job yet. I started reading all these self-hel p books. And I remember reading like it was probably like my 10th book in a row and I realized that the words in that book contradicted like the second self-help book that you know one was like it's all about goals. The other one's like it's all about taking steps or whatever it was right. And I and I all of a sudden I was like you know my life is the same. I've read all these books but my I still literally live in the exact sam e condo in Baltimore doing the same job like nothing has changed. And so I just made the commitment t hat whatever the next book that I was going to read I would just not read another book until I'd done ev erything in that book. And that's when I quit my job and I did a whole bunch of other things. And I've act ually more or less stuck with that in terms of like when I read books or even listen to podcasts I usually d o with an intention to get something out of it. And I usually have notes up. And so that's so my intake on information because I get asked a lot I'm sure you do. Like I actually don't read that much. I definitely do n't read nonfiction. I read like fantasy. Red rising baby. That's right. But it's because usually I get overwh elmed with the amount of things I would have to do. And so I'm like I don't need more information. I'm li ke I'm like I could read a chapter and be like all right that's it. I like it'll take me two weeks to do this. And so then like the rest of the time is doing that. And so. How do you ensure that the things that you're rea ding are giving you good advice? Because if you didn't move on before you took two weeks to go and do the thing. The thing was dog shit. You've spent two weeks going backward. So I would probably I would make the argument that I wouldn't have gone backwards because I would have gained the experience. A nd so I would have more context to know what the second thing was going to be. And that's just kind of l ike the trial by fire learning through iteration. And I think I tend to do more of that. Sort of a win or learn philosophy. Yeah. And I would say that like there are entrepreneurs who are definitely like super super d uper planners. And their entrepreneurs are more like let's just move and break shit and we'll figure it ou t. I tend to be really this on the micro in terms of like move shit and break you know like we'll figure it ou t as we go. And I just tend to be a planner only in the big like very grand like what do I really want to do i n 10 years. But the majority of the time it's like let's see. And we'll learn. I've learned so much like so mu ch of the content that I have comes from just fucking up in business and people were like this is such ori ginal content. I was like this is just because that's what my life was. I just like I made this mistake and it d idn't work. But I said this one thing one time and then all these people bought and I was like oh how do I do that again. And so like it was always through iteration and I've read all these books but there's just kn owing how. Or sorry knowing that and knowing how like knowing that maybe this works maybe. But onc e you do it it's a different type of learning where at least for me it's about been that way. If you could re ad you could read a hundred books on sales but when you take your first cold call all of that goes out the window because you actually have to you actually have to sell. We'll get back to talking to Alex in one mi nute but first I need to tell you about element element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything th at you need and nothing that you don't stop having coffee first thing in the morning your adenosine syst em that caffeine act on isn't even active for the first 90 minutes of the day but your adrenal system is an d salt act on your adrenal system element contains a science backed electrolyte formula of sodium potas sium and magnesium that helps to regulate your appetite curb cravings and improve your brain health. T his orange flavor is absolutely insane it is the best way to start the day to beautiful salty orangey drink it' s refreshing if you've been doing hot exercise and it's just my favorite way to wake up I've been using ele ment every single morning for over three years now and it's still just as enjoyable as when I first used it r ight now you can get a free sample pack of all eight flavors with your first box by going to the link in the description below or heading to drink lm n t dot com slash modern wisdom that's drink lm n t dot com sl ash. What wisdom this is related to something I wrote last week don't be so worried about people who i mitate your work they only know the what but not the why if you stopped being creative so would they a photocopier isn't an artist even if it can recreate them on Lisa. I love that because even to like you you are source in that situation and so everyone is there for like a subset of you and they require you to live you don't require them and the equal opposite is I think we should be more fearful of when everyone st ops copy copying you like the day that no one copies you is far far more frightening than the day everyo ne's copying you. Jimmy Carr refers to China as a cover band. You know it's like that the cover band of th e Beatles and he says you know that they're good and in many ways they're able to produce things at m ore scale and so on and so forth but they're not driving the innovation forward in that same way. Yeah t he idea of getting upset about people copying is just ridiculous like. Yeah that's all I that's all you underst and why it's painful right if someone's gone through okay let's test and test and test and test and test an d then finally find a particular form of that formula that works and then. 10 people downstream get the benefit of this hard laborious effortful late night grind and iteration and they just got to be like oh that t hing yeah. I so I think that like they'll be able to copy what they can see but they won't be able to copy w hat they can't see which is understanding why each of those pieces are in place and when something ch anges in the future they won't be able to iterate from there because they don't know why it was there in the first place right and so like I mean I've obviously dealt this with in a business context where like real dollars are at stake and so like in the gym world you know Jim wants for those you don't know I had a bi g licensing company we had 5000 locations and anyways so we had basically business processes that we would you know iterate and figure out why this worked and then. And so then I had I used to keep a list of names and then I just got too long and tiresome to keep the names of all the people who tried to take the stuff and then saw it as their own. I say I say their names every night before I go to bed you think I d on't remember you I remember all of you and so. None of them 10 years later are still around and not a nd none of them even came to a 10th of the size of Jamal and it was because it wasn't theirs like the per son that I would be far more afraid of somebody who comes out with a significant. Better system than w hat we had to help gyms make more money and help their you know help their clients more but like to t his day like there still isn't one and that one's too much is still the category king in that in that industry a nd so it's like just and that's because we put and we were talking about this earlier everything is an R an d D for us and so we actually like we're the only licensing company that had an R and D department and we would test we call them plays but we test plays every every 14 days and so we'd spend 50 or 100 gra nd on just a test would be like all right let's test. This new marketing campaign or we'd say hey let's test t his new high ticket sales processor hey what if we did what if we try to sell memberships via chat let's ju st give it a shot see what happens and and honestly. 70% of the time it would it was worse than the cont rol like it didn't work as well and what we would do is we presented a licensees and say hey guys guess what we just spent 50 grand on that you don't have to spend money on look at the results of this cell me mbership total dog yeah yeah yeah the thing is is that most people are actually really happy to know tha t it didn't work because they felt like they were screaming. Scratching initially oh great I don't have to do that one like someone did that test for me so anyways all that to say. Unless you have that that trail of b odies behind you that led you to figure out this one thing when there is a kink in the system because so me external condition changes which it always will they then don't know which means you're always still going to be ahead yeah that's very interesting yeah because. If you understand the physics of the system if you understand the dynamics of why you're doing the things that you're doing in something changes y ou can respond but it goes back to people with high standards. You have to presume that you win in the weeds. You have to presume that you win in the weeds and if you do and if you're continuing to be this close to it. As soon as things change you go that's interesting why is that happened. And that then allows you to continue to iterate and you see it because you're in the weeds right somebody who's all the way zoomed out just like yeah copy paste that they're like they're one they're late because they have to see t hat it's working see this working consistently so there are three six months behind then they start trying to figure out how to implement it and then they start implementing it and then what they don't see is th e things that made the conditions that made it work to begin with and so like if you just assume that you 're always in the weeds. Then it means then sure second through 10th place will always copy number on e but to the victory go the spoils and so you will like no one gives a shit who is fourth place at the Olympi cs. Reminder that if you want to be exceptional you're going to be different from everyone else that's w hat makes you exceptional you can't fit in and also be exceptional both have discomfort when you fit in you have internal conflict because you're not being 100% confident. You have external conflict because you're not being 100% you when you're exceptional you have external conflict because everyone sees y ou as different pick one when your friends start to say you've changed remember it's because they don't know how to say you've grown. I define words a lot because it helps me kind of like made sense of the w orld and like exceptional is like an obvious one right we use the word exceptional like you are not like ev eryone else. But even saying it like that like you are not like everyone else and so if someone says you're not like everyone else then you can just reframe that is like I'm exceptional and that's not a bad thing. A nd most and I don't and I actually think that most people have like this might be counter to most people' s beliefs but I think most people have the potential to be exceptional and because most people are pecul iar in their own way they just stifle that because they want to be accepted by most people but in so doin g never accomplish what they want to do because they conform. And so like if there's probably a lot of t hings about the world or even your world around you that you're like this never made sense to me but t hen you do it anyways and I think that a lot of innovation and a lot of what makes people exceptional is f eeling you know thinking that thought or seeing that thing and then being like huh I don't think I'm going to follow that rule anymore. Like why do I need to shower twice a day? Huh, like I don't know like why d o I need to wear different clothing? Huh, like there's just a lot of these social norms that people you kno w usually pass down to us or they're, you know, bred into us in high school and college and things like th at. But it's like you see a guy who you know wears a cowboy hat and dresses a certain way and he basica lly wants to say I am this I am this archetype of person. But if cowboy boots aren't as comfortable for yo u as new balances are and you know that and you still wear cowboy boots I would call you a fraud becau se like that is like it's like a micro rebellion against yourself. It's like there is and like I look at old people a lot because usually they don't give a shit anymore. They've just like given up and there was a survey that they did where the number one reason that old people like don't have as much drama and they're happi er is they say they cited they literally don't have time for it. Like literally they don't have time for it and I found that so interesting. It's like well if I'm going to eventually be that way when I'm 80 I might as well j ust start being that way now. And so they usually wear like really comfortable footwear and like they the y keep their surroundings like whatever weird peculiarities they have they just accept them. And so I thi nk a lot of like if if life is a long journey of self acceptance I think that earlier you can accept your own pe culiarities as just part of you rather than trying to justify them or mold to what you to the archetype that you think is acceptable within your social circle. At least for me like there's this period of discomfort whe n you change anything because everyone around you wants you to fit within the label that they are com fortable with. But they also have the anchor of what you were before. Yeah exactly and so they try and li ke they people don't like that and so they're like no no I like you in this box so just say I know you're havi ng a little thing right now don't worry just just and they just want to shove you back into it. And there's t here's a lot of uncomfortable conversations that you have to have where it becomes really socially awkw ard. And so like I said one the other day about like going home for the holidays and the reason I don't lik e doing it is because often I have to confront a lot of people that I haven't seen in a long time. And they'l l speak to me in a way that I don't like and before that I would roll it off like whatever no big deal but I d on't accept that. Didn't you torpedo a family holiday a couple of years ago? Many. Yeah I think but that's the when your friends start to say you've changed it's because they don't know how to say you've grown . And because they see so few people who have so it makes sense that they don't have that so I see that as a lack of skill not not malice. Like it's not that they're bad people they just don't even know it because so few people do change so people will do grow. Have you seen this image it's a person whose heart and head are flowers it's kind of a 2D drawing it's a bit of a sketch and they say this person with the kind of s maller flower head and heart says you've changed. And the person on the other side with this huge bloo ming thing says I should hope so. Yeah I haven't seen it but I see it in my head. Yeah it's brilliant one of my friends George Mac told me this five years ago I think I'm astounded by how many people want to be spectacular in life but also want to be normal. By being normal you are by definition aiming for average normal people get normal results exceptional people get exceptional results. You literally can't do what everyone else does and expect to not get what everyone else has got by doing what everyone else does you guarantee average results. Okay so this comes down to everything that like business I mean obvious ly I come from the business and investing world like if everyone is jumping on to crypto like by the time y ou have all the information to make a perfect decision it's too late. And by the time you have consensus or everyone's like that's a good investment it probably isn't because it's already been mispriced because it's already like it's already inflated and it's above what its intrinsic value is. And so like good investors fu ndamentally can think for themselves and it's such an easy thing to say and such a hard thing to do. And so it's being able to say if I shut myself in a room and I had to come up with a value for something and ju st use my own mind to come up with what I think this is worth. It's that that answer that you get in a roo m in isolation with no internet connection that you believe in that number more than every single other person's and most people can't do that. But like that ability and then what happens though is if you reall y have to believe in that rather than everyone else's you double check your fucking math because if it is different than everyone else's you have the like that is what opportunity looks like. It's called advantage. Right. And it's like and you have the potential to make a shitload of money or lose a ton of money becau se you didn't check your math. And so the more I've been reinforced for thinking independently and in t he beginning it's on small things and then you just continue to reinforce that cycle of huh I came to this c onclusion on my own it seems different than everyone else's but I think I think my thing makes sense. So I'm going to do that. How would you advise someone to overcome that regression to the mean that pull to not make waves to not be heterodox or non-typical when it comes to their decision making because it 's hard. You're talking about this internal conflict versus external conflict. How do you make the internal conflict more important than the external conflict? For me I was more miserable trying to make everyon e else happy than I am now with everyone else unhappy with me. And so I think like from the social grou p I had before I quit my job if we're going all the way like ground zero to today. I talked to no one from t hat time of my life compared to today and I was absolutely miserable and unhappy and unfulfilled. And I would say that the majority of those people probably don't like me today because I changed my life. I ch anged I didn't do what I was supposed to do. He thinks he's so fancy now etc etc. And I think I'm just oka y with that. And so I think coming to terms with the idea that I could be absolutely rejected by everyone I know but like me I was more okay with that because the alternative was I didn't want to live anymore. And so obviously there's degrees and there's continuums and there's stages of where people are at with that. But as that being the taken to its logical extreme would I rather live for them than live for me? I wo uld rather be hated by everyone than like myself. There's a degree of honesty is the right word but it's al so too simple like being completely 100% truthful with yourself. If that's the way that this is why I told yo u about the motocross the rally cross a thing that me and my house might love. Okay so you know Colin McRae these guys that drive four wheel there's the dude in the co-pilot seat and it's five left bends that shit these guys that go to go and watch this are in the middle of some fucking wood in Ayrshire right in S cotland and it's pissing wet and it's November and they've got a pawn show on and they get to drive for however long to get to this place you can even see thinking about it the hairs on my arms are standing u p this is how fucking dope it is so these guys are there. And they see some dude in overcast rain freezing cold soaking wet go. And then they turn to turn to all of their boys and they're like. Watching someone who loves anything with that much purity. Fries me up it fires me like we love watching we don't watch i t for what the cars are doing we watch it for what it does to the spectators and that degree of like just a n encumbered passion. Not being apologetic like they've probably they're probably wearing comfy shit t hey're not wearing cowboy boots you know what I mean no one could they look like a like a large condo m in this pawn show do they care they don't care and. That's purity that's truthfulness and honesty and really. Like what what are you hoping to be able to look back on your life or for people to say after you'r e gone if you don't do that. He was such a good guy and he never rocked the boat yeah he was such a go od guy and he always conform to our expectations. He was such a good guy and he was so predictable p eople think and I did throat a lot of my twenties I thought that. What people wanted from me. Was som eone that they could easily predict. But I realized when I thought about the people that I loved in my life I didn't love them because of how predictable they were. I love them because of how unapologetically t hemselves they were I have a friend who nearly. Ended a relationship that he's still with who either the l ove of his life who's probably gonna end up marrying because he refused to not sleep on the floor for six months as part of a Alex Becker is doing it the moment like he's like sleeping on the floor seems to be lik e a pretty dialed idea and she's like I'm not sleeping on the floor well I am so so they didn't sleep togethe r for like you know for like a long time. That's those are the people that you love and those are the peopl e that you can because they pay such a high price to do that yeah you can be very reliable at presuming that they mean what they're saying because if they didn't really mean what they're saying they would co nform they would check taken easier path. I love all of that. My I was trying to kind of consolidate it for f or myself and the listeners. For me it just it comes down to truly valuing your opinion of yourself more t han other people's opinion of you and it's just it's an easy thing to say and it's incredibly hard to do beca use that means that if you disagree with everyone else in the room there's this meme that I love I don't have you seen it there's this little cartoon of this one little guy and then there's this little thing that I love . There's like an ocean of people that way and it just says yes you're all wrong and I just like I feel like tha t meme my jerk actually my my brother and editor in the books in the battle against nihilism and and an d towards truth. We send that meme back and forth to another when we're like yes everyone is wrong a bout this word like we are right and I think it's just being willing to like but the only way you can believe i n a thing or an idea or even yourself is because you have the evidence behind you that supports that you r belief isn't full of shit so that when you're in that room and you come up with that one number and yo u say I think everyone's wrong I think this is actually what it's worth. You're not just making it up to to sa y you believe something different you actually have proof and evidence that you're not full of shit and I t hink that's the work is like I did I looked into a lot of the stuff on this on the floor sleeping. I think it chec ks out I'm going to do it like I think everyone else is wrong. I think everyone else is wrong and everyone's like you're an idiot and you're like I think you're wrong and that's okay you don't and it's just most peopl e can't do that just the idea of being weird is too much like just like. Do you ever this is quite old now it's at least a decade old I think it's called 50 days of rejection or 100 days of rejection I love it already so it's a it's a series of experiments that you do every day for 100 days there's a different one each day and one of them is. Ask for free coffee when you go to Starbucks I love it just say hey can I have this free yeah an d it's I don't know whether it escalates over time but this weird stuff things that you do to people in publ ic things that blah blah blah and it's trying to overcome that. Like it sort of it's in your throat you know w hen you feel that and you take cheeks get flush and everything kind of gets hot get embarrassed around here yeah it's that embarrassment is that shame it's that what if they think. Yeah, why yeah. What if the y think what yeah so yeah I someone should redo that it's like a decade old now but someone should re do I think I'm certain it's called 100 days of. YouTube idea that would be great YouTube idea to do 100 1 00 days of rejection or whatever it is. But next one I just want to like I promise you if you can actually go through 100 days of rejection your life will change because you will realize that at the end of the 100 day s you're still alive and nothing changed it's I'm going to die. Yeah, that's the fear the fear is I'm gonna ask for the coffee and they're gonna say no and then everyone's gonna laugh at me and then I'm gonna be a lone and then I'm gonna be unsheltered and then I'll be dead yeah. It's catastrophize to death we all do i t and so I mean obviously come from a sales background so getting people to say no to me is something that I'm now. If you've asked drunken Newcastle girls where they're going tonight darling for a decade a nd a half on the street trying to give out wristbands for a free entry to a club night no one wants to go to you get good at rejection as well that's what I honestly think that. Everyone is always going to campaign for the thing that they did right you're always going to say something along the lines of I think people ca n learn a lot from sales and I'm always going to say I think people can learn a lot from being in club prom o but like honestly dude the. The inside that you get in the human nature from doing that from seeing w hat do people object to and why do they object in that way and what happens if someone like it's physic al with you because you've tried to do and you go oh well I wasn't in the wrong so de escalating this sho uld actually be quite easy and I can have faith that everyone's going to see me as the right guy even if so mebody else took objection with what I was doing so yeah long story short become a club promoter alri ght next up next on. There's a big difference between becoming known and becoming respected don't le t an algorithm convince you otherwise. I mean I think this is probably super pertinent for for people in o ur position but. I'll go from the Internet perspective and we can circle back to IRL but I mean a lot of peo ple will make content so obviously I make stuff for me to like talk about artists making things for themsel ves like I make most of my tweets are just like notes to self. But like if I ever feel like I have to sacrifice w ho I am or the values that I believe in in order to like get more views or something like that I see it happe n more times than not because the algorithm and the views and the likes become kind of a proxy for con forming in their own way like everyone likes this type of thing do more of that and that makes me feel v ery like dance monkey dance and I think there's there's few things that kill my soul more than that and s o I would rather do you know I'd rather the object that I have to be able to do is do more than that. And if the algorithm shut me off tomorrow and I continue to make stuff that I find interesting that 10 people find interesting that is actually the same stuff as me then just have these viral hits that I feel like I'm Ron ald McDonald in and just feel like I've completely lost my soul and I I do think as a side note that if you d o the first one where your intentions to maybe help find the 10 people who are really interested in your thing you probably will create more of the viral hits but when you saw for the other way I think you acco mplished neither. More creators fall out of favor because they become cringe them because they becom e irrelevant I love that yeah I love that I think it's I think it's true I think. If you think about the thing that you do almost anything that anybody is creating is public facing because it wasn't public facing it would j ust be a hobby. Doing your painting because you love painting is a hobby doing your painting to try and s ell it is something that you do as a business or as a public project. The flywheel is so vicious in the positiv e direction and even more vicious in the negative direction if it becomes. Cancerous or uncool or untren dy or catastrophic or cringe to be seen to be watching or listening to or consuming the thing that you ma ke it is you're permanently going to be swimming upstream and it is only going to get worse. Which is w hy you look at Shane Gillis is a really great example of this at the moment he's someone who is great at his craft big platform move to Austin got all of the multipliers in place but he isn't cringe. And because h e's not cringe if you've watched beautiful dogs his Netflix special it's not uncool it's like there's this idea i n publishing I've been doing my research ahead of the book there's this idea in publishing called the sub way test. Would someone be prepared to have the full desk jacket version of your book out on the subw ay and if your book is like stop erectile this function. The erection problem. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah , yeah, like like no more flatulence today or something like if that's if that's your book it's gonna be very difficult or if it's written by somebody where it's like oh really don't want to do that so and this is the poi nt where. There are tons and tons and tons of people on the planet who have huge platforms that nobo dy respects. And I've seen even within my seven year career of doing this the arc of people trade integrit y for exposure and not be able to buy it back. Because there is no return policy on your integrity on your reputation and those people would give anything to be back in the cool kids club. I mean this is like I lov e this entire train. I was thinking like what what creates like what's what's timelessly not cringe right so li ke if cringes the ultimate like what we don't want then like what is forever not cringe and the only thing that I can like really think of is just true authenticity which is an overused word but. Again easy to say ha rd to do. Again easy to say hard to do I think what is what is forever cringe on the equal opposite side is i s pandering like whenever you're seen as someone who's only doing stuff for other people's opinion app roval likes whatever especially double cringe when it's for your own personal gain. And so if the equal op posite of that is something that is to my personal detriment that is truly something that I believe in it ho nestly doesn't matter what it is because there are some people that probably believe things that I don't believe but I genuinely think based on what I see that they genuinely believe it and it's and they don't re ally stand to gain much for believing it. There's no cringe there. It's just like that fan man fucking believe s that and I think that some of the you know some of the characters in our current you know political sp here and things like that like many people you know you say the word Trump and you have half the peo ple who hate you and the other half that love you. It's like I think most people agree that he believes wh at he says now whether you believe the content of what he's saying is a different story but like I don't thi nk many people have called him as somebody who's like I think he's he doesn't really think that about hi mself like I think he I think he really does and even I'm just gonna push the edges because that's where y ou have to like explore the fringe. Look at someone like Kanye who's been borderline canceled for I mea n multiple times right but like why is Kanye quote uncancellable because he hasn't been right not really l ike if he came out tomorrow with a hit a hit album I'll bet you it would fucking sell because I think that at least for me from what I see I think he does what he believes and people want to be like he's mentally u nstable there's all these other they be like no one thinks he's being fake and I think that like I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I thin k that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's wh at I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think th at's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what I think that's what if that becomes the North Star of like I just never want to become cringe then it's just n ever be fake in other news this episode is brought to you by byorn at the K road is coming to you by And this z I think sued own without using TRT.

I think that avoiding cringe and aligning authentici ty as best you can and it's a permanent battle because you are not inside of a vacuum and you see other people doing things and there is temptation and you need to respond to the audience's feedback in som e regard or else you're just going to be making something that nobody fucking cares about but you also need to not compromise too much. One of your old ones related to this, people are attracted to authent icity but it's hard to define for me. Here's my best attempt. True alignment of what you think, what you say and what you do. The hardest part is realizing that our thoughts are fucked and that we have to fix t hem instead of faking the next two. I totally agree. You said it. Man, yeah that's dead on. I've got a really cool idea. Herostratic fame. Many people would rather be hated than unknown. In ancient Greece, Hero stratus burned down the temple of Artemis purely so that he would be remembered. Nowadays, we hav e nuisance influences who stream themselves committing crimes and harassing people purely for clout, Herostratic fame. Yeah, that's like you gain the world but you lose your soul kind of. I mean, I'm also the last person to judge and so if that's what you want then by all means do it. I don't think it's what people want. I think that they think it's what they want. I've been playing with this idea or this name, one of the concepts that the book will be focused on, intentionalism and essentialism by Greg McEwen is one of m y favorite ever books and I figured it would be a nice like hat nod. Doing what you mean to do and wanti ng what you want to want is so fucking hard to do and so rare because we're built to conform. I think on e of my life goals and I can summarize it in a question but is to be fearless and it's equal opposite courag e is another word but I love this question which is what would you do if you weren't afraid? I love thinki ng about that when I'm thinking about big life decisions like what would I do if I weren't afraid? It's usual ly like the big one, the bigger thing that I really want to do but I'm afraid to do it. It's like that's what I sh ould do and to your point about you had the five things that you told your team. The one that we have is originally it was something that we called one of one which is make only things that we can make. You'll never see a Coca-Cola business breakdown from Alex Romozi because anyone can do a Coca-Cola busine ss breakdown. That's not one of one content but if I say I double the sales of this company by implement ing these four things, no one else can say that because no one else did it. It's one of one. As the book lun ch and whatnot came, we took one of one and it became this big massive thing and it stopped being abo ut what can only do things that only we can do. It was about doing things that we didn't even know we c ould do yet which became one of zero. That's why that became the brand that I'm going to continue to wear for the next few years and build that association. I think that that kind of encapsulates my personal life goal which is like what would I do if I weren't afraid and what would I do if I knew I couldn't fail? The idea that I will never wish for fewer epic stories at the end of my life and I've never regretted failures. I'v e always regretted things that I didn't try. Just along those lines of trying to create more bias internally t owards action rather than inaction and normalizing consequences of failure as we said earlier, win or lea rn. I think that little frame, believe it or not, for anyone who's on the teetering edge of what should I do that thing, when I was debating quitting my job which is still the hardest decision I've made to this day, s till of the many that I've made, was I figured that if I didn't make the entrepreneurship thing work, I wou ld have a hell of a story for business school. That was actually the reasoned argument that I gave myself for being willing to quit. I think that with my experience, I'll still be able to get a job and I'll have a really cool story of entrepreneurship that I could use to apply to get into business school and then eventually g et a job later. Most times we catastrophize any failure to death which is like I'm going to fail, I'm going to lose all my money, I'm going to be homeless, no one's going to talk to me, I'm going to die. If you play it out two natural steps, okay, I lose everything, what do I do? I would probably have a couch or floor that someone would lend me because at least socially, I haven't fucked everyone I know. I have that. It's like okay, I would have some capacity to do that. Okay, is there anything that I could do in the meantime in o rder to make money? Well, sure, I could drive Uber and strip and I've already told this story before but f or me, that was genuinely my plan B because I knew that I could probably make 70, 80 grand a year drivi ng Uber. I probably make 150 stripping, maybe 200, strip at the gay bars, the guys pay better and then b oom, I've got 280,000 a year, I could live on the floor and then I could restart again. That's because I don' t have a lot of shame with that kind of stuff. That doesn't matter to me. But I think playing out the fear, L ayla says this and I love it but that fear is a mile wide and an inch deep and so it looks like this ocean that you're going to step into and drown but as soon as you step into it, you realize it was not that deep at all and you can keep walking through it and I just love that visual because a lot of times when it's like we ha ve this anxiety around this big decision we have to make, if you actually take the step and realize that it's not death, you're not going to drown immediately. There's plenty of other steps you can take from there even if you get a little wet. Did I tell you my story about a friend who went through a cancellation and w as worried it was a coward? Oh, like a public cancellation thing? Yeah. Okay. I went for dinner quite a wh ile ago now with this guy that I was pretty interested in and he knew what I did and we went sort of bum ped into each other and what you're doing? Let's go for dinner. I knew about the situation that he'd bee n through but he didn't know that I knew so I was like, tell me, there's no pressure and he was able to be unencumbered. Basically, he went through like a tough cancellation where kind of the whole world cam e down to bear on him and he was telling me this story. It was a very interesting time, like being very refl ective and he said, my whole life I'd been worried that I was a coward. I was terrified that I was a coward but I'd never been through a situation where I'd had to bring absolutely everything to bear on my life an d I'm a hard man and I like to hang around with hard men and I like to shoot guns and do jujitsu and be a round Navy SEALs and stuff like that but I always had this fear in the back of my mind that I might secretl y be a coward and then he said the cancellation thing happened and it wasn't a very difficult one rep ma x. It wasn't a really hard CrossFit workout. It was something outside of his control and he used this term that I love and he said, I could always hear my better self clearing his throat in the room next door. I alw ays wondered what would happen if I had to really, really wrangle everything if the whole world came cr ashing down on me and I wanted to work out whether or not I was a coward and he said, thankfully he k icked the door in and came through but I just love that I could always hear my better self clearing his thr oat in the room next door but he'd never been fully tested. Done lots of hard things, a lot of acclaim, ver y successful, blah, blah, blah but we all know that's your thing, right? Like, but I'll know about whether o r not you've left something on the table and yeah, there was always just 5% still in the tank when he was doing things about how he felt about how invested he was. He always had to get out of jail free card in o ne way or another and yeah, I love that. I could always hear my better self clearing his throat in the roo m next door. Two things on that. So I think if we're consolidating some of the points we were making ear lier, the but I'll know refrain. I think that a lot of the personal excellence comes down to making the but I 'll know more important than the but everyone, what will everyone else think? Because the I think the tr ue test of whether you're a quote perfectionist or not is if everyone else in the room says it's exceptional and then you say, but I'll know it's not because I don't think it's exceptional yet. If you still break what ev eryone else believes is beautiful so that you can make the thing that you make it the way you want it to make or make it the way you want it to be, I think that is probably like the truest test of whether or not you really do value your own opinion over those of other people's and if you want to be true to the quot e, the art, whatever your art is, I'm using it as a generic term, it could be the career or the even like the t he financial projections that you're supposed to do at your company. Like there is a way you could do it and do it absolutely fucking excellent and there's a way you could do it. You could phone it in and proba bly not get in trouble, but the things that you'd know and then you'd be the type of person who always phones it in and that to me is disgusting and that would make me disgusted with me and that is the thin g that would make me want to peel my skin off because I would hate me and I think that's why so many people do hate them because they do settle and they do make these things and they do know and still ig nore it and so they ignore the man in the other room who's clearing his throat and they shut the door an d they lock it and they never let that guy in and so they look like everyone else, they act like everyone el se and they get what everyone else gets. America was built on the backs of men who smoked cigarettes, drove without seat belts and had bacon for breakfast. If you miss your bio hacking routine this morning, you're going to be okay. There's a time for leverage, but there's also a time for violence, which is just bru te force. People get really obsessed with optimal, which is getting the most bang for your buck, but ther e's also maximizing, which is just getting the most bucks. You lose more life trying to optimize everything than just living it. The stress of trying to be perfect is killing you more quickly than your imperfections. I t hink that's an ode to being willing to take huge amounts of imperfect action towards one goal and being willing to sacrifice other things for an extended period of time, despite the fact that other people will sa y they're making a sacrifice. Like when we enter seasons, I call it the season of no, which is where you ha ve extended duration where I say no to almost everything and most people say that's unbalanced and th ey hurl that as though it's a bad thing. They're like, that's so unbalanced. You're like, yes, that's the point because if I had a balanced outcome, then I won't have the outsized return on this one thing. Again, ther e's so many of these little insults that people will throw at you, like you're unbalanced, you changed, tha t they intend as insults. But if you actually don't take your society program response and say, oh, they m ean to insult me. But if you actually think about what they're saying, they're saying something that's true . And then we just need to be okay with that truth because that was the choice we made to begin with. And so I think about that a lot, which is like, how many things do people tell me that they intend to insul t me with that I can take as a compliment? Didn't someone bump into Layla walking down the street? Ye ah, it happened so recently. So yeah, we're walking down the street. Someone bumps into her. We don't always walk side by side because there's lots of people. So we split up sometimes. Anyway, she comes b ack to me and she was like, guess what this guy just said? And I was like, what? And she was like, he call ed me a skinny bitch. And I was like, what? And she, but she seemed so happy. And I was like, I just kind of shook my head, like tell me more, explain. And she was like, I mean, he said I was skinny. And I was lik e, this is the perfect example of him hurling an insult and her choosing not to be insulted. Thank you. Ye ah, thanks. Really? Yeah. Do you really mean it? Like, I wonder how many times we've been insulted, eve n in my younger days where someone said something to me that like, if I had my current brain, I could h ave been like, you really mean it? Thanks, man. And yeah, like so unbalanced. I remember, I remember I took that as such an insult for such a long period of time. Now part of that was because when I was bein g brought up, balance was like one of the big frames of my household was like, you have to be balanced, which really just meant you have to be awesome at everything. But balance was the, was the word. So b eing unbalanced was a term that was used as an insult. And so for so many years I wanted to be balance d. But then I was like, well, nothing great was ever achieved by people who tried to be great at all things. And so I was like, okay, I'm just not gonna, I'm not, I might not have a great relationship for a long period of time. I mean, there was like, a lot of people don't know this, but in the early days of our relationship, even when we were married, I told Liz for the first three years, I said the business comes before our mar riage. So a lot of people don't know that. And I was like, well, to me it made sense. It was like, most peop le break up over money. The business makes money. So the business feeds us and then we will be okay. And that was kind of my thinking around it. And we eventually flipped that to like, if we're good, the busi ness will be fine. But it took three years to get there. But all that to say, like, I think having periods of im balance and maybe to be fair, if we, if I hadn't had that priority at that time, maybe Jim Walsh wouldn't have been what it became. And so I can't look back and say like, I should have done it different because i t's really easy to say that now. But like, I might not be here to say that if I had been that way. Oliver Berk man's got this great frame where he talks about choose in advance what you're going to suck at. Oh yea h. It's in 4,000 weeks. And if you are a type A go getter person who has what I called the curse of compet ence, your options in life are restricted more by what you choose than what you can do. You will feel dis quiet when something that you used to be great at begins to slip because you focused your attention els ewhere. You used to be in really great shape. You said that one of your goals this year was to get a raise or to be able to buy your first house or to find a partner or to do whatever. Hey, guess what? If you're sp ending four or five nights a week going to places where you can maybe date or going out on dates or doi ng whatever, you're probably not going to have as much time to dedicate to the gym. If you want to get that raise or be able to save your first house or whatever, you're going to have to work later, which may be means that your friends are going to drop off. If you pick whatever the thing is, there is a price that y ou begin to pay. And this cycle began for me so frequently toward the back end of my twenties where I would dedicate myself to a thing, then something else would begin to slip. So I would then go, Oh, I'll jus t, I'll, I'll just give a little bit. I'll just give a little bit to that. And it's not an additive system. It's multiplicati ve. It's not two plus like three. It's two times three. And that means that the more that you attend to the thing that you say that you're going to do, the more the gains accrue to you. And then you can still pivot back, but you need to periodize things. And this is, this is a frame that I wish, even now, it's, it's still som ething that I struggle with realizing that now isn't forever. The thing that you're doing right now doesn't need to be forever. If you are coming out the back of the searching for the partner thing and you're like, Hey, guess what? I gained 15 pounds. So, all right, well, dedicate yourself for the next six months to goin g to the gym, but this isn't the rest of your life. And once that thing's done, Oh, well guess what? I'm bac k to, you know, 12% body fat. I feel great about myself. What's next? It's not forever. Yeah, it's just for n ow. Yes. We have a frame that we actually use a lot. I always think about these things from a business co ntext, but they end up retroactively, you know, applying to life. But when we're making big strategic deci sions, we say like, which problems would we prefer? And so rather than talking about like the gains and what's the upside, if we have like, you know, let's say we're going to make a big investment in software f or this company, or we're going to make a big, you know, a huge a new service line, or we're going to jus t decide to develop a physical product, right? I mean, I know you, you're like, you really on the just back half of a big decision like this yourself. It's like, okay, let's imagine what the problems are going to be if w e, if we decide to do this new service category. Well, some people are going to complain that they're not getting results from this thing. We're going to have a ton of, like we might have some negative reviews i n the short term that we're going to have to deal with. Like, let's look at what happens when one of our favorite customers tells us to fuck off. Like, what, like, like, let's really sit in what each of these problems is. And then when we, when we spell out all of the problems, and we don't even think about the upside, say, which of these problems do we prefer? And which are we more equipped to deal with? Sometimes we have really amazing innovation and in my opinion, like really solid decision making that comes afterw ards that minimizes kind of the post decision regret, because we also know what negatives would have c ome with the path unchosen. Because most, most times like our regrets come from the path unchosen b ecause we imagine it only with the upside. We only think about, I think there's a, there's a fuck, there's a book that where a girl lives many different versions of her life. And Midnight Library. Yes. And the thing i s, is that there's these pieces of her life that she imagines are going to be amazing. But then she realizes her best friend's dead, or all of a sudden she's pregnant. And you're like, whoa, what happened? And so we don't take into account on the paths not taken the things that we would have lost along the way. An d so I think really good decision making and also regret minimization is that when you make the decision , you think about the downsides too, and you remember what those downsides are. And for me, that ha s been one of my strongest frames for like, I didn't decide to do that. Were all that? Oh yeah, those were a lot of I'm glad, those are problems I'm very happy I don't have to deal with now. In other news, this epi sode is brought to you by Nomadic.

Thinking about the perils of over optimization is something I brought u p with Heberman last year. And you know, I think a lot of people, I have a friend who's a very well know n DJ that told me he was falling out of love with DJ because he knew that it was damaging his sleep. And because he knew how important sleep was to performance, that he'd kind of got him the bar stool had b een turned upside down a little bit. And the thing that he was trying to do was being sacrificed for the th ing which is supposed to facilitate it. And that's where the you lose more life trying to optimize everythin g than just living it. The stress of trying to be perfect is killing you more quickly than your imperfections. All right, so I'm glad we came back to optimization because there's obviously on the extreme, there's gu ys like Brian Johnson with blueprint who are trying to like live to 200 or live forever. And I respect that, I respect dedication to anything always. And interestingly around, I've always been a maximizer. So I've ac tually not really been an optimizer in my life. And it's just like, as soon as I have an input output equation where it's like n equals x. And it's like, and if I want 10x, I do 10n. I'm like, great, then can we do 1000n? Like I just want to do as much of that as I can like possible. But when we, like I love competitors who like optimizing because I always see it as a weakness because it's so easy to exploit. It's like, oh, you need yo ur eight hours of sleep or you need your morning routine. Or if you don't have your supplements, you're just totally fucked or like, I didn't have my coffee this morning, so I can't function. Like I love to compete against people like that because they're so easy to break. It's fragile. Yeah. And so what happens is the o ptimizations become superstition. Correct. And so my, my fear around and maybe I take a more extreme stance on this, but like, I've always wanted to be able to with an internet connection and a laptop and a f old out chair, go make money. And always have that as my North star that anything else is extra. And I fe el like I lose more quickly when I get into this optimization cycle around, because I remember years ago, I bought one of those rings that tracks your sleep and I kept trying to like set sleep PRs and you can only get so high anyways. And then I started stressing more about not hitting sleep PRs that I was sleeping w orse than when I wasn't tracking it. And so then I was like, well, fuck this thing and I slept fine the next ni ght. And so obviously microcosm, I'm a big believer in tracking progress in general, but just the idea that we become so overly romantic around these things that sometimes you just have to break shit. And som etimes you have to be violent. And sometimes when you're on your journey, you're not going to sleep m uch and you're going to, you're going to like, there was a two year period where I did turnarounds for gy ms. I flew around the nation every month I would do a new gym. I ate out of gas stations and I ate gas st ation food and I gained weight during that period of time. And it was for then and not forever. And I'm i n shape now. And so whatever, who cares? And so like, I used to tell this when I was selling weight loss t o people, I'd say like, who cares if you get in shape for six weeks out of 80 years. And like right as they're about to sign up for a membership, I was like, you want to sign, and then this is how I would sell longer memberships. But like, it's also true. It's like, you want to sign up for the six weeks, but like, Susan, like w ho cares if you lose 20 pounds and you're still overweight six weeks from now and then you gain it back t he next six weeks and you're still the exact same weight for the rest of your life. And so I just, I think the absolute dedication and maximization so that it becomes a part of your identity and your character that has been one of the outsized returns that I've gotten in my life and just being absolutely willing to say lik e, I'm pretty violent about this, but like, list all the things that you aren't willing to give up for the dreams that you have. And that is what the person who will beat you is willing to give up. There's a phenomenal blog post that talks about why guys aren't getting girlfriends. And this is pre-modern mating crisis. So it's not, it's not to do with like imbalances on Tinder and Tall Girl Problem and all that stuff. It's a guy who th inks that the bare minimum is acceptable. So he talks about how I'm always on time and, you know, I hol d the door open and I say, please and thank you. And I'm nice to my mum. And the dude, I'll never forge t it. There's this line in the blog post with a guy who's like, having this pretend dialogue with this imagina ry person goes, so fucking what? There's a guy who does all of those things and he plays the guitar. Well, it's like the song lyric, baby, you the whole package and you pay your taxes. Yeah. I mean, I think also to the same degree, I mean, like I'm, I'm no mating, whatever expert, like no idea. I got married early, did al l the things that, you know, whenever you're not supposed to do. But yeah. And yet, if you, like, if you w ere true to you, like what's the most uncringed thing, right? Is you being you. I'm pretty sure that I turne d away plenty of girls who were like, this guy's successful. He's in shape. Uh, you know, decent looking, s trikingly handsome. Um, but they'd meet me and they'd be like, what a fucking weirdo. But the thing is, i s like, they, like, and I remember I had, um, there were so many girls that I was like, you're pretty and I, I , I just don't care at all. And so I like, I just, I wanted someone who got my peculiarities, who was like, no t only like accepting of them, but just like down for it. And so I've, I walked through most of my, and to b e fair as a side note for anybody who like wants to quote, be exceptional, you're going to be different an d people are going to think you're weird and like, you might not get second dates, but real, real, you're n ot going to want the second date too, because they're not like you. Like when you get unplugged, you're like, oh wow, everyone's a sheep. This is weird. And you just go on a zillion first dates to be like, you had another one, you had another one. And every once in a while you see a glimmer in someone who they'r e like, oh, you think for yourself, like you can make your own conclusions. I remember when Laila and I went on our first date, we were, we were, we went at a frozen yogurt store. And so of course I'm like, so you know how they make their money here, right? I was like, so these things weigh this, they charge this per ounce. And I was like breaking this whole thing down. And she was like, oh yeah. And they do this an d this. And I was like, wait, you see this too? Like you, it wasn't like just like Alex was talking about this. Li ke the child out of the fucking sixth sense or whatever it is. I was so excited because normally I would jus t have to like talk, I would talk about the stuff that at least I like to talk about. Cause then we'd pass the not good dating strategy. I'm just saying it wasn't attained myself. Yeah. But then she also like talking ab out this stuff. And I was like, holy shit. Well, what's the alternative? The alternative is to find someone w ho falls in love with a role that you're playing. Right. That's the best that you can hope for. Right. And th en lock yourself in to a future of having to perform in a way that this person has become accustomed to. And there's nothing that can be more lonely than I can possibly imagine than pretending every single ho ur of every day that you're someone you're not. Do you know who Dr. Robert Glover is? He wrote No M ore Mr. Nice Guy. No, but I like the title. Had him on the podcast last week. This guy is a fucking boss. So cool. Like mid sixties or something now, huge goatee. Smoke cigarettes. Probably, probably rip starts. Th is office by the way is completely, it's like smoking enabled. We're in Vegas. And he had three essences o f an attractive man. And I think it's a really lovely frame. The essence of an attractive man, he's comforta ble in his own skin. He knows where he's going. And he has fun while he's going there. Nailed. Nailed. So good. So good. But like that. If you think about that as, okay, so if, if, if, if you're in like, even like an attra ctive man, whether you're married or not, like, I mean, on the flip side, it's like, do you want to be marri ed and then choose to become unattractive? Well, no, of course not. And so it's like, if those are three id eals, it's like you have, you have direction in your life, you're internally comfortable. And the fun part is what makes you, I mean, partially attractive. And now mind you, if you just have one of the three, you ca n, you will find a mate who's attract. Like if you just know with all your fucking soul, you're going somew here, people will want to rally behind you. Even if you're not having fun. And even if you're not that com fortable. Right. And even if you're not that comfortable in your own skin, but you're like, that guy, like n o matter what, he's gonna fucking get there. On the flip side, if you don't know where you're going and y ou don't even have much fun, but you're like, that guy is comfortable. Like say what you want, but that g uy is good with him. That's an, like, that'll look like if you just had one. And if you just have a shitload of f un, you don't know where you're going and you're not that comfortable, like you'll still have people. Um, I'd probably prefer the first two to the third, but, you know, but like as ideals, like fuck very strong. The o nly insults that hurt are the ones we believe. Next time someone insults you, remember they're going to die. Everyone will forget about them. And if no one will remember them, then you might as well forget a bout them. Now they are irrelevant. Your dream, your actions, your outcomes. So now you know what t he inside of my head looks like. Um, um, I mean, I, I, uh, I put almost everything immediately to death. U m, and that's like, maybe it's a coping mechanism. Maybe it's perspective mechanism. Um, but like, I wa s really strongly considering having a parody, um, tweet profile of my own that I also run that no one wo uld know that I run. That is just like all my very, very controversial beliefs. Um, but I'll throw a taster out now. Um, murder is just picking when someone dies. So it's like, if you hate someone, it's like, you can ju st look at them and be like, Oh, you're going to die eventually. Like, and so like the idea is like in your mi nd, you could murder every enemy you have. You just, just don't get to pick the time. But I just find that so such a, like murder only changes when not that someone's going to die. And so if you think about like retribution on someone's like, this person said this thing to me, I want to kill him. It's like, Oh no, you do n't even have to, they'll die. They're going to die already. Like you don't even have to, like, don't worry a bout it. They're going to die. And so it sounds so silly, but just connecting those two dots. I was like, wow , that's incredibly peace giving. So like, why have a vendetta when life will take care of them for me? Uh, and so I just like, you know, as a, as a, as a totally different frame, I was talking to somebody who has ca ncer, uh, in my life and, uh, they were like, really concerned. They were like, this has a, as a 95% mortalit y rate over the next five years. And, um, you know, me being me, I was like, well, you know, 70 year olds probably have a 60% mortality rate over the next five years. Anyways, I was like, and life is a hundred pe rcent mortality rate. So, you know, worse, yes, but like how much worse? And so like, um, they didn't thi nk it was funny, but, but just as a, as a, it was intended to be comforting. It didn't succeed. Um, but, uh, all that to say, uh, these, these things that people cast on us, um, it's just whispers in the wind, right? Lik e if we think that our whole meaning is, is so infinitesimal, the idea that someone else can influence our trajectory when they themselves will disappear and become irrelevant seems so silly to me. And they do n't have our best interest at heart. No, they have the opposite of our best interest. They're literally tryin g to destroy you. What about the only insults that hurt are the ones we believe. What about that? Oh ye ah. Um, well I, cause I, like other people get offended with things. And then I've also had times where so meone says something with the intention to insult and it doesn't. And I was like, how can I get that to ha ppen every time? And so it's the classic example of, you know, Chris, you have green hair and then you would say, okay, whatever, sure. But you don't believe it. So it doesn't really matter. And so I think there 's, there's a, there's kind of a dual sided like lesson, at least for me in this is that when we are insulted, I t ry and pay attention to it because I think, okay, either there's something here that they're right about an d that I don't like about myself, in which case the response is to agree. And that's what's so frightening. And so it's like, if someone so recently had someone, someone made some thing blasting me about, um, I don't go home for the holidays. I made this whole, I made this video about it. Um, and in the first five s econds of the video, of course, I'm like, if you love your family, fucking go home. This is not, this is for ev erybody else, right? But of course no one actually watches that who makes that piece of content. And so they just went on this tirade about me and I just said, God, I suck period as my comment. And because t here's no, the stoic response to hate is to agree and one up. So level one is agree. So someone says, Alex , you're fucking it. And you're like, believe me, if you knew half of it, you'd think more than that. Because it's the only way you can respond. And so my mental judo for these things. And I've just, I try to, now the good news for you and I is that we get lots of practice, right? Every day we have people hating on us. An d so I get to, I get to practice. So like people, people meet you in real life and they try to insult you. You'r e like, dude, I have so many reps on this. Like, oh, good. And so it's just like, can I want up their insult? Li ke if someone insults me, it's like, dude, let me do you think that's good. Let me tell you how to really ge t me. Right. And so just the frame of agreement evaporates conflict. Yeah. That's your thing about, um, most people are more interested in winning than being right. Yeah. So you just say, sure. You're right. Ye ah. Alex, you're an idiot. All of your business advice is terrible. I'd be like, you're right. Now what? Where do we go from here? Right? Wasn't that fun? And so we talk like, cause I like it human behavior a lot, bu t like it's called, it's a extinguishing event. So like when you, when you, when you pull a slot machine, wh en, when null is the outcome, it nullifies agreement is the ultimate nullifier for insults. And I think that lik e if the faster I reprogram that, so it's like, if you ever feel insulted, either like first, is it, is it true? Like if you are insulted, you believe them. Okay. Uh, do I believe them because there's an element of truth? If t here's an element of truth, why am I insulting? I should agree with them. It's just because we have some ego behind it of like, I'm going to be perceived a certain way. Or maybe because it's poking a hole. It's w edging into the inauthenticity that someone has brought into the light, something which we thought we were able to keep in private. One of my other life goals is to die with no secrets. Well, just because if we think about, at least for me, if I think about authenticity, to be seen as I truly am, then I would have no s ecrets. And I try, you know, I try really hard to not hold anything back content or otherwise. Um, so that I don't need to have, I don't want to have a hundred faces because if you always have something in the back room, that it means that to these people, you're this person and this is in the back room to these p eople, you're this person in the back room. But the fewer back rooms I have, the more everyone is in on e room and I can be just me. And that means that some people will hate me. Um, and some people will li ke me, but they will actually like, or hate me, not the idea or some facet. Like we were saying earlier, like when you're in a relationship, putting on the act and putting, being the performer, they're not hating th e idea of me. They actually hate me. And at least there's some weirdness about like, at least that's true. I n other news, this episode is brought to you by Shopify.

There's a lesson I learned from Rob Henderson, which is like an interesting addition to what we're talking about here. And he asked the question, why do we fe el insulted or why do our cheeks flush when somebody accuses us of something that we know that we h aven't done? And the issue here is that we don't exist in a vacuum and we care about other people's inte rpretations of us and the disinformation campaign, even if it's grounded in falsehood can still negatively impact our status. So even if you know that this isn't true and all of the rest of it functionally to everybod y that isn't you, or maybe many people that aren't you, or maybe some people who are influential that a ren't you, this can have the same impact as if it was true. So that the man being an island and I have fait h in my own word, as soon as you start to build this out, there's a reason for trepidation there. I think so. I was trying to think about like the, what are counter examples? So like, if someone attacks your charact er, right? So let's say someone comes out and says, Alex did some sort of sexual allegation or something like that, that I know isn't true, whatever, but they say that now that's going to besmirch my reputation, right? Now I can't be like, you're right. And if you really knew, right? So I can't, if you knew the half of it. So like, so like, those are the situations, right? So like, if someone just says like, you're, you know, you're full of shit or your business advice is bad or whatever, then that's one thing. But in those situations, the only counter that I have seen is to be louder. And so if someone increases the volume on something, I d on't believe that you draw attention to that person. I actually, I've more or less not been in the, I'm goin g to address someone directly, but I may counter what this person says without addressing them and be 10 times bigger and louder about it as a way to counteract that. And so like, I had a bad reputation in col lege, which I, I've, I've shared some of that in my story before. And the reputation was that I was a Fland erer and was, you know, all about girls and whatever. And so I wanted to not have the reputation. And s o it wasn't like I was going to go talk to those girls and be like, I need you to recant your story. I had to m ake my actions so much louder that I was no longer going to be that way for an extended period of time to counteract that thing. And so if we're thinking about like how to respond to people being shitty to yo u, if you believe what they say, and it's true, agree and one up. If what they say is something that isn't tr ue, but does besmirch your reputation, then you can only be respond by being louder with the truth. An d I think that like, I think about these things, obviously we're in a position we have to deal with this all th e time, um, as like almost playbooks for dealing with shots. Well, this is one of the things that people got wrong about Dave Portnoy's cancellation. So Dave had sex with maybe two, two or three girls that sold t he story. No separately. Oh, okay. Sold a story to the Atlantic, I think, pussy number, um, sold it, sold a st ory to someone and they were, they were looking around and I think they're still going. I'm pretty sure t hat only a couple of months ago, they tried to notify some pizza event that he was doing. Do you know t hat we're investigating him about that? And then he called them out. So what's happened is there's bee n a million me too allegation things that have come across people saw the way that Dave Portnoy respo nded. He came out of the fences, absolutely swinging, like swinging so hard said, this is fucking bollocks. It's baseless. I think you maybe even somehow had video evidence or audio evidence or some kind, may be internal CCTV cameras. Basically all of this stuff is dog shit. Yeah. People took Dave Portnoy didn't tak e any shit and, and, and he didn't back down and he didn't do an apology and he didn't do the rest. It's li ke, yeah, guess why? Because he didn't do it. Right. Because he wasn't in the wrong. Yeah. If you are the guy that did do the thing, you don't have that. That's a firm foundation. What you're doing there is just c reating this like cathedral of, of lies and dog shit on top of a sandcastle of lies and dog shit, which will th en get found out and you'll get hit. You'll get slammed 10 times. Way, way, way harder. Rightfully. So to be fair, that's the thing. So learning, okay. Why did he do this particular tactic? Well, he run that play bec ause the basis of where he was at allowed him to. Loud as shit about the truth. One, one thing that we t alked about earlier with canceling and I have, um, so relatively contrary and views on canceling. Um, I ge nuinely believe that you cannot be canceled. You only are, you can only be canceled in two ways. You ca n be canceled if you choose to stop making content, stop being public or all means and methods and cha nnels of communication that you do not control remove you from it. So like, for example, uh, there's Tat e, right? And he had his, uh, like he's not allowed to be on the platforms, but they allow his content to b e on the platform. So has he been canceled? No, I would argue not. And there's still other platforms. An d he continues to make content. So you only, so to me, this is actually really, um, uh, heartwarming secu rity feeling. And I get warm and fuzzy around that reassuring. Thank you. Um, because it means that can cellation is you have to agree to be canceled no matter how bad, like, if you mess up the platform one, y eah, the part, yeah. If they, if they, if they had AI face recognizing him and, and of limited from the platf orm, he would be canceled. Like there's no method of communication outside of in person who'd have n o leverage agreed. But barring that, if you continue to make content, no matter what you did, people wil l find out about you more people will know it about you and your message will get disseminated. And w hether you choose to like recant something that you did or, you know, like right or wrong apologize, or d o what Dave did and say like, this is complete bollocks. He's my little UK term. Uh, and just be even loud er. You choose to be canceled. And I, I like that because I, I like to have as many things under my control as I can. Yeah. I've been like thinking about the Streisand effect because everyone's always said, you kno w, cancellation makes people bigger. I think that is cope. I think it's massive cope. I don't think that canc ellation makes people bigger. Alex Jones, for instance, when he got, he got about as close to unpersand, I think, as you can get very, very difficult. I wasn't seeing for the last whatever, five years, eight years, wh enever he got taken off Twitter, I wasn't seeing him on YouTube unless he was on somebody else's show . Uh, I wasn't seeing him on Instagram. I wasn't seeing him on Twitter. Uh, Steve will do it as a good exa mple as well. Like he can't even be in the background of other people's YouTube videos and he's got sha res in rumble and he's doing all this other stuff, but still that's a pretty big unpersoning. And I think it's ki nd of cope to say, Oh, but so many more people are searching them. Like the entire internet is built on c onvenience. Yeah. If you think that making it more inconvenient for someone to access someone makes them bigger, you are fundamentally forgetting human nature. Now maybe in this, you know, beautifully utilitarian, rational view of the world, the person that wants to see the thing, they might go and get the t hing, but it's like, Hey, guess what? Like TikTok's got an unlimited scroll and they're just going to keep go ing. And if they don't appear, they don't appear. And to draw this into IRL for everyone who's like, okay, well, that might be convenient for Alex Jones and whatnot. Like he can't, he can't or can't be canceled, w hatever. I think that at least for me, the through line on this is like, if you do some embarrassing thing, w hich happens, we're human. The only way it compounds into being like a much bigger problem is if you b ecome a recluse, you choose to not go out. You choose to not, you just disassociate with everyone else. Like you choose to agree to the terms that the people around you are telling you you have to agree to. A nd that's where I think you can say no. Destiny's got this idea. He told me this story. I think it was like Vid Con or VidSummit 2012. And Destiny's sprayed it around a bit in his career. And he was at this huge You Tuber convention and his ex-girlfriend or something got access to his Twitter account and leaked his dick pics on his Twitter while he's at this VidSummit thing surrounded by his peers. So he's trending. So it's n ot only, oh my God, look what's happening on the internet. It's, oh my God, the internet has now becom e real life and it's in front of me and there's thousands and thousands of people and they all know what' s going on. And finding Nemo just keeps swimming, just keeps swimming from Dory. His is just keeps str eaming. He says everybody only remembers your last four streams. So sure enough, you went on first str eam, just the chat is lit up taking the piss out of him and like here it is. Second one, still lots and lots and lots of jokes. Third one, like a few less. Then fourth one, it's pretty much gone. After four streams. It's no t funny when we've all heard it. Yeah. So True Geordie got, it's like a British UK YouTuber, big guy. And a few years ago, his DMs got leaked from his verified Instagram account saying some like pretty dirty sex s tuff to a girl and she was of age. She was of age. There was no, it was like, it was kind of, I guess it was in timate and like embarrassing or whatever for him, but he, he was silent, pretty much silent for five days and then got probably the best roast comedian in the UK to come on and annihilate him for 20 minutes i n a video and put it out on his own YouTube channel. And it's that be rabbit thing. Tell these people som ething that they don't already know about me. Like what joke are you going to make that Steven tries? L ike literally the most vicious, funny, sardonic UK roast person hasn't already said, and it showed that he could laugh at himself. Dude, this is the, so this is the take what they say, one up them, right? And so like , I'm going to- Take what they say, find a person who is professional at one upping them and then bring t hem in and then publish it to your million person YouTube channel. Yes. Like we, so we actually teach thi s from a customer service. I know I'm going totally cross polyp nation here, but we call it, there's, there c an only be one person in the angry boat. And so customer comes in, they're shouting. And I learned this from my, like, one of my earliest business mentors. I worked at a fur coat dealer. So like brushing, you kn ow, furs, it's a glorious job. I was 18, it was the summer. And so this lady walks in and I was at the retail s hop, which normally I was in the warehouse where the peasants were. And, and so this lady comes in an d she's making a whole mess of noise. And the guy walked towards me, the owner, and I see him like roll his eyes. And then as he turns, turns the corner to go where she can see him, he like his face turns into a smile. And then he's like, he's like Mrs. Robinson. And then he just goes into rage mode. And I was like, whoa, what's happening? And he was like, wait, there was a button missing on your jacket. He's like, giv e me that jacket. He like pulls out. He's like, who sold this to you? Who let you walk? He said, did anyone see you in this? And he was like, tell me their names right now. I'm going to get them. They're going to b e out of here. Like we're going to end like we're going to get, terminate their employment. We're going t o make sure that they never eat again, all the stuff, whatever. And she all of a sudden she back, she was like, Oh no, no, it, you know, no one saw me in it. I just got, I just saw it when I got home. If you guys cou ld just, of course we're going to fix it of like no question what's hard. And so of course she takes the ticke t, she leaves, he comes to the back and you just looked at me and he was like, only one person can be in the angry boat. And I, and it was a lesson that has stuck with me in like, and so in this, in this instance, ev eryone is angry at you. And so the only thing you, cause people are contrarian by nature. All you can do i s be angrier than them at whatever it is. And so like getting the comedian to like, Oh, you think he insult ed me? Like here's a picture of my cold shriveled dick after a nice cold, after my polar plunge. You want t o see like, so it's just, it's like, can you do that? And it's just leaning into what feels unnatural and uncom fortable, but it's the only way to respond. You cannot wish for a strong character and an easy life. Each is the price of the other. What if what you're going through isn't hard? What if you're just sensitive? I think that most of us can look back on our lives to 10 years ago and think about the problems that we were de aling with then. And think about how much of a pittance and how small those problems were compared to the problems that we deal with today. At least that's how I probably feel. Maybe you feel the same w ay. And so I then think, okay, well, if I feel that way about the problems that I had 10 years ago, then 10 years from now, Alex will look back at the problems that I'm dealing with today and feel the same way. And so if he feels that way then about the problems that I have now, then the only difference is the pers pective that he has that I don't have. And so I might just be a sensitive little pansy and maybe these aren 't problems at all. Maybe these are just facts of life and I need to habituate to them. Because I remembe r my first lawsuit, right? Because it's like when you're in business long enough, you make enough money, you're just going to get suited is what it is. And I was listening to Elon Musk talk about this. And at any gi ven time, Tesla has hundreds of lawsuits at any like just they have massive departments of legal just for all the different things that are going on. And it was thinking that a requisite for success is a problem. Lik e you cannot become the wealthiest man in the world and not get sued. Like getting sued is an indicator that you're actually is a requisite for being there. There's no person has been there without this. And so reframing what I used to consider a problem as a point of evidence that I'm on the path that I originally c hose. I remember the first time that I ever tried to incline chest press 20 kilos. And as I got it up, this is in the Center for Sporting Excellence in Newcastle Gym. And as I got it up there, I didn't have the tricep str ength to be able to keep it. And I watched this thing slowly come down to one. And it just landed on my nose. And I like sort of bailed it bailed it out off my nose. And now it's not even it's not even the warm u p to the warm up set. So the problem is that we don't have very good memory. We don't have theory of mind for ourselves for a previous version of ourselves. I've always thought that it would be such an amaz ing tour. Maybe Newer link can do it some point in future. You know how people want to go back in tim e and they want to see a different place. I would love to go back in time in my own mind. And remember the texture of my own existence. And what were the things that I thought about? I've told this story bef ore, but it's pretty illustrative. Day one is a journal that you can use for your phone. It's pretty good. And for me, it's big shit. It's like big things are happening. If I open day one, some some fucking shit's going d own. And breakups and illnesses and being worried about people dying or whatever, whatever the fuck. I once opened it to write down that the MC in room two, the R&B room of our Saturday nightclub night, had told me that he was leaving to go to a competitor event 15 miles away. And I remember thinking th at it was so salient to me that it deserved to go in along with breakups. And do I go on this reality TV sho w or do I not? Because I was adamant that that would be the beginning of the end. Because the only rea son that Asian sock, the Asian society came down was because they like this particular MC. And if he we nt, then Asian sock would stop coming in. If Asian stop stop coming, then that would mean this. And the n and then the whole business would go and I'd be dead. But I don't think that anymore. And there was one there was one time where I hadn't worked our events for quite a while. And a DJ that used to work f or us came through and he thought that he'd wind me up by saying three minutes before we opened tha t something was up with one of the CDJs. Something's up with one of the CDJs a couple of minutes befor e you open. Things are bad, because there's usually not a spare and it means that the night's going to be delayed or whatever. And there was lots of people outside waiting to come in or whatever it might be. A nd he was expecting a response from a previous version of me, which would have been the one that wo uld have gone into day one and typed about the fact that the CDJ hadn't worked. And I just said, oh, oka y, well, I don't know, we'll fix it. And he called out, broke the fourth wall and said, oh, it's not broken at a ll. I just thought that I'd wind you up, but you didn't play the game. I'm like, oh, right. It's the, you've gro wn or you've changed thing. He was a juke the, don't punk the game. Yes, don't punk the game. Yeah. I t hink the point is to always punk the game as many times as you possibly can, especially if you're the one getting the game played on you by yourself. What's your framework for quitting things and moving onto something new? How do you know when you're quitting because you're being a bitch? And how do you know that you're moving on from something that's no longer worthwhile? Man, so there's a handful of q uestions that I think everyone faces that you never know the right answer to. And so it's like, how much is the right amount to invest versus consume is one of those answers. Like if you invest, if you consume nothing and you invest everything into it tomorrow, you end up with a life where you enjoyed nothing a nd then you have a big pile of delayed gratification in the extreme results and no gratification. Right. An d so these are rather than either ors, they're continuums to be managed more than problems to be solv ed. And so I think just from a decision-making framework, that's number one. Number two, so with rega rds to this one, which is do you push or do you pivot, which is how I frame this question, pushing like, do I push through whatever this hardness is? And there's something that's insight that I think I can go to or there are fundamental things that have changed that make my original hypothesis wrong. And so I'm tell ing the secret right now, but for me, I won't quit if no new information has come to light. And so if I say, I'm going to do this based on these assumptions, if those assumptions have still held, then it's a push sit uation. If there's new data that's come to light that changes the nature of why I'm pushing or the outco me for what I'm going to get from pushing or the way that I'm pushing is incorrect, then I would quote q uit. But quitting has a lot of heavy terminology in, you know, I'd say personal motivation masturbation. P ivot's much softer. Right. Because I think that everything is a pivot except for stopping. And so I think ev en language matters a lot and I care a lot about language. And so like nothing is quitting unless you stop. And if you continue to pivot and you continue to push either of those are activity. And so you will stumbl e upon something that does work in which case do more of it. And so that has always been my frame, bu t it's, I have an initial assumption or series of assumptions for a desired thing. So let's say I want to build my social media brand. I say, okay, I believe that if I make, you know, content about things that no one e lse can make content about that is more higher level business stuff than is out there because most of th e YouTubers are YouTubers, not business people, there will be an audience for that. And in the beginnin g I will have fewer people who follow it. But if I make really good stuff over time, eventually people will t ell people and I will get better at making content and that will grow. So if I'm at year two and and it's, an d the thing is, is like, do I have leading indicators? And so like even in business stuff, like we, I don't need the outcome, but are there leading, leading indicators that are telling me that this I'm on the right path. And so identifying ahead of time, just like we have a problems that we identify, like, okay, if we succeed, like people are going to recognize you in the street, you're not going to be able to go out as much. Like al l these, these are problems that I'm going to have to deal with. Cool. I'm willing to pay for those. But wh at are the, what are the things along the way that will tell me that even though I haven't achieved Mr. B eastom, that I'm on the right path. And so I think having those little indicators allow you to keep taking s teps towards the ultimate thing and continue to push. I mean, I have a different tweet, which is that the world belongs to those who can continue to work without seeing the result of their work, continue to do without seeing the result of their doing. And it's really the person who can do that for the longest period of time. And that's usually because they're still getting leading indicators. It's just that it's a mounting to a much bigger mountain. And so like, if you want to do big shit, it takes a way longer period of time beca use the easy shit, the little Hills, everyone conquers really quickly. I'm on time. I say please and thank yo u. It's like so fucking what. And so like, if you want to do something that most people can't do, literally ju st extend the time horizon on the things that most people can't weather. Like there's so much opportuni ty on the other side of being willing to persist for an extended period of time on the correct path withou t getting positive reinforcement from your environment. And the longer you can stick with something wi thout that positive feedback loop in terms of the big external thing, the, the, the easier the opportunitie s are because so few people can pursue them. In James Clears atomic habits, I think he interviews mayb e the Chinese weightlifting teams, head coach, and he asked what is the difference between the absolut e elite world champions and the ones that simply qualify. And the coach said, the absolute elite are the ones who can continue to come in every single day without getting bored. That was it. And Matt Fraser t alks about it as well, where he says that doing an hour and a half of monostructural work on the rower, you've got to do zone two. Hey, guess what? You don't even get the benefit of feeling like you worked th at hard. You just get to kind of, yeah, whatever, like 24 strokes a minute or something like slow zone two , whatever, whatever the thing is. But no one's fired up for that. He said people make a mistake in believ ing that I'm fired up to go and do that session. I'm not fired up to go and do that session. I just go and do that session. We were saying, so there's a lot of people say like do the work. And in Jim launch, and it's c ontinued into our stuff today, but do the boring work is what we call it. And boring is what makes you ric h, boring, the boring activities. It's the, it's the double checking the emails. It's writing the followup sequ ence that you really don't feel like writing. And honestly, just getting it done will make you significantly more money than not getting it done. And so it's like, it's, it's, it's falling with a lead from a month ago an d just being like, Hey, by the way, are you still interested in that thing? It's the stuff that you don't want t o do. Like no one's like, I can't wait to follow up with these leads that haven't responded to the last two t ext messages I sent. But if you respond, if you follow up to everybody, you will make more sales than yo u know. I'm assuming that it's an effective strategy because there are ways that you can continue to chu g away and do a thing with no positive reinforcement. But Hey, guess what? That's the direction that yo u're supposed to be going in and you're walking over there. Yeah. Well, that's a push and pivot, right? Lik e if, if no one responds, then I would say I have zero leading indicators, but if you have enough response rates, then it, then it's worth the toil. But I, I, so, I mean, Michael Phelps talks about this too, with, with s wimming, like just laps after laps after, like he doesn't even have the variety of like different moves or di fferent, like it's just laps, just sheer volume of work. And I call the Rocky cutscene and almost every succ essful person that I have ever encountered has gone through not a month or a year, but many years of d oing work without reward where they have to do things that other people find boring and they have to s acrifice things that everyone finds interesting that most people want to do during that entire season of t heir life. And they basically sacrifice a season of other things that they would prefer to do to do stuff tha t they would not prefer to do because of the one thing they want most. And that's the Rocky cutscene. A nd instead of lasting five minutes, it just usually lasts five or 10 years. You're going to lose sleep. You'll d oubt whether it'll work. You'll stress to make ends meet. You won't finish your to-do list. You'll wonder whether you made the right call and have no way to know for yours. This is what hard feels like. And tha t's okay. Everything worth doing is hard. And the more worth doing it is, the harder it is, the greater the payoff, the greater the hardship. If it's hard, good. It means no one else will do it. More for you. I think a lot of entrepreneurship and even personal growth is training yourself on how you respond to hard. Beca use in the early days, hard was, ooh, stop. This isn't good. I should, I should, this is a warning sign. This is a red flag. I should slow down or I should stop, you know, I should pivot. But the more I think about it as a competitive landscape, as I'm clear on what this path is supposed to look like and these rocks and thes e dragons are things that I'm going to have to slay along the way to get the princess or get the treasure. I get happier about the harder it is because I know that no one else will follow. It's a selection effect. And I think if you can, if you can shift from this is hard to no one else will be able to do this, then it's, it flips fr om being this thing that you're like, oh, poor me to, oh, poor everyone else is going to have to fucking tr y. Yeah. And I think that is so much more motivating as a frame for the exact same circumstance. Yeah. T hat's awesome. I was thinking a lot about the lonely chapter that we talked about the last time. That wa s the best, most powerful idea. I think that we came up with. And if you see that basically being no short cuts toward getting the thing that you want, there are ways to be more and less efficient. And there are ways to do things with more and less of a positive disposition, which can actually make the journey feel an awful lot easier. But ultimately, if you assume that largely everyone needs to go through the same ch allenges that you're going through, every single difficult thing that you do is kind of like a massive wall th at you need to get over. And you go, wow, fuck, I'm so glad that I've got over that wall. And think about how many people are going to be selected out. It's like the hunger games, you know, think about how m any other people are going to fall at that wall there. People only root for people who don't need it. The a mount of times when I was on my lonely path, where I was too different from the friends that I had, but not successful enough to be friends with the people that I wanted to be friends with. That's when you w ant people to root for you. That's when you want people to support you. Once you've already won, peop le are like, he's amazing. He's so good. But that's the time when you need it the least. And so you always have to be the person who roots for you before everybody else does. And it's usually a single clap in the auditorium for a very long period of time. It is a slow clap that's just you rooting for you. And that visual, I think, is one that you can take because it is. People struggle to do things alone. And the path of the exc eptional person is one of an exception, which means that you are not with other people. And rather tha n fighting that or bemoaning it, see it as an indicator that you're on the right path. Because if everyone e lse were cheering you on, then it means you're not in the right place because it means you're just like ev eryone else and that's not where you want to be. It's an interesting paradox that the energy it requires t o start doing something is way more than the energy required to continue doing the thing. And that the beginning of doing anything results in the lowest amount of reward, both internal and external, than wh en you've been doing it for ages. So I think about this a lot with the show that there was this stat that Sp otify told us 85% of the listeners of this show found us in 2023. And I thought at the end of 2022, remem bering at that point, I'd been on Rogan, we were at like 650K, we've been doing 550, 600 episodes deep. Like I've got it, I've done the thing. Like this is me doing, if this isn't fucking doing the thing, I've moved t o Austin, Texas, I've got an 01 visa, I've got like all the rest of the stuff. Jordan Peterson's been on twice, you've been on. And yet the, what? Everything up until that point is two months of growth. Yeah. I mean , we made, we made more money for just from a revenue perspective, we made more money in more s ubs in one month, December of last year than we did in the entire first three and a half years of the sho w. So it's this odd paradox. And one of the things that you need to ensure, I've had this idea about prote ct your passion at all costs, because if you, if you begin to hate the thing that you do, you negatively cha nge your trajectory. And that means that at the time when you can benefit the most by every single unit of work, which is the later that you go, presuming that you continue to hit that upper trajectory, if you'v e completely killed any passion or desire to do the work in the early stages, because you've, you've not p rotected it appropriately. That can be by focusing on the wrong things, by not rewarding yourself, by not building it with people that care about you, by, you know, just not, not celebrating when you hit milesto nes, all of the things that actually help to keep you going. Being a character. By the time you get to the st age where each unit of effort allows you to gain a thousand or a million of each of the things that it woul d have done at the very beginning, you've inverted the, like the passion equation takes way more energy to start a thing than to continue doing a thing. And yet in the beginning, the rewards are way lower than they are at the end. But if you don't protect your passion, your motivation is at its lowest when you are at your highest amount of efficiency in terms of returning your time put in. I think a hopeful message tha t anyone can think about who's about, who's in that hard period or in that start period is that it won't ge t harder. Like this is the hardest part. And so if you can just make it through this, everything else is down hill. It's not that the things that you're, the dragons are going to slay aren't going to get bigger. They are, but you become so much more equipped to slay them back. And you have so many more allies. You hav e people in the stands cheering for you. You have the audience. You have all of these other things that a re behind you. But at the beginning, it's just you with a stick against a bear. And arguably that fight is a h arder fight to win than beating a dragon when you have a nuclear bomb and six nations behind you. And so it's not even like the, the size of the hardship. It's just also the resources and how few of them you ha ve and how so much of the beginning is literally burning the one thing you have, which is time, because you have no leverage. You don't have the money to pay other people to help you. You don't have the res ources to go like get someone to, to no one can learn it for you. It's like, there's a lot of the things that, t hat we care about a lot. Like no one can work out for you. It doesn't matter how much money you have. No one can learn skills for you. And so in the early days, like it feels so painful because you're like, you lo ok around to see who can help you. And then you're like, fuck, it's me again. And I think getting comfort able with the idea that each of these things, kind of like slumdog millionaire, if you've seen that movie w here he, I'll give you the TV, he goes through his entire life of randomness and he gets on there. Who wa nts to be a millionaire version in India? And it has 12 questions to make a million dollars. And from only 12 random experiences in his life that seemed meaningless at the time, was he able to answer all of the questions and then ultimately when the skills that you develop along the way, like Steve Jobs learning ca lligraphy that then became Apple fonts that, you know, transformed how we type. Those early days, tha t little trench winning in the weeds, oftentimes gives you these huge advantages later on because you h ave more context than anyone else. And so rather than lament them and hate the fact that you're going through it, remembering that these will be arrows that you put in the quiver that you're going to be usin g to slay the future bigger dragons. And so expecting it to be easy is what makes it much harder than it e ver was. I've always loved earning my stripes with the things that I've done, whether it was with nightlife or running the podcast or doing whatever. And I think there's like a degree of nobility to it, but functiona lly that's kind of, that's just like, it's a nothing. Like what's the, what is the, what is the nobility? But I thin k the reason that you can feel noble about it and the reason that it gives you a positive reward is you kn ow that you understand the things that you understand every single inch of the things. And that if you w ant to hold a conversation, we went out for dinner with our new CFO and accounts people on Saturday a nd they said, you ask a lot of questions. Most people don't ask very many questions. And I also don't car e at all about accounts really. Like I'm not doing this for money, but they said, you ask a lot of questions. I said, well, I don't ever really want to walk into a room and not be able to hold my own, at least just co mpetently if it's to do with something that I care about. And the same thing goes for this. Like I started t o learn about focal lengths and frame rates and negative fill, reverse contrast lighting. And then sure eno ugh, two years after we started doing it, a bunch of different, I sent you the Instagram thing, like this rea lly awesome film Instagram that I've been following for ages, picked us up for what we were doing and g ave us props independent of the talkie thing, which is fundamentally what we're here for. And we create d this entire new industry of like cinematic podcasting, which was recognized by, as far as I'm aware, like the best cinematic, it's called film lights at film lights. People can go and see on Instagram, like the best d ecoder and analyzer of cinematography. And two years ago, when we started, I remember thinking, fuck , like I love the way that they've broken down what happens in ad Astra. Oh my God, the whole thing wa s shot on 35 mill. Each different scene's got two pairings of colors and stuff like that. And then, but the r eason that we were able to get there, at least in some part is I can have a conversation with people. So e ach of the things that you do when you not only win in the weeds, but live in the weeds, then allows you downstream from that to see the things that other people aren't seeing. There's a quote that I love from Dr. Keshe, I'll probably butcher it, but experts have more ways to win than beginners do. And so if an ex pert goes into any setting that they're expert in, they have so many faster feedback loops that reward th em in the moment before the ultimate outcome. So if you're a master video editor, there's so many thin gs that you can do that while editing, you make one change, and then it looks right, you have a positive f eedback loop. And so I think when you're on the start path, you can't look at the outcome as the only po sitive because you will never make it. And so the positive frame that I've always used is sure, you can ha ve the external ones of like, I like thinking about my first videos had like 13 views. And I'm like, well, if I h ad an audience of 13 people, I used to spend years pitching, you know, weight loss stuff to rooms of 13, and that was fine. And so thinking about that way was helpful. But the most helpful frame was thinking about who I was becoming as the asset that I was building. So in real time, whenever I finished a long da y's work, I was becoming more like the type of person who could work for five years without reward. An d that would be part of the story I would someday tell. And so some of the biggest reinforces I've had in my life has been future casting the story that I would tell about the shitty period that I was in. Like I rem ember when I was sleeping on the floor at my gym because I didn't have enough money for two rents. A nd I was like, I will fucking tell this story. And when I lost everything for the first time, I like I have the scr eenshot of the bank account. Like when I show it, people are like, Oh, look, there's that thing. But they f orget that there was a person who screenshotted it to be like, this won't fucking happen again. And I thi nk having a larger narrative of where you're ultimately going, one gives you the vision of where you're li ke, the like, knows where he's going. But it allows the dragons that you have to slay along the way, the h ard things that you have to overcome to feed into the larger narrative of who of the story that you'll so meday tell. And so like no one ever tells stories about the hero who made it all happen immediately and had no hardships. No one cares. But like, okay, you were born to a billionaire. Is there a story there? Not really. But everyone loves the story because we can see ourselves in the character and how much we ho pe to be like them. And it's the being like them, not the having what they have that we usually like. And so reframing ourselves as the hero of that narrative in my harder times was what really got me through t hat and thinking, I will tell the story someday. Have you heard Rogan talk about the be the hero of your own story thing? Oh, dude, it's as old now. I think this is maybe, maybe even 10 years old, maybe 10 yea rs old. And he's in one of his old, he's in the LA podcast studio. And he says, imagine that you're in a mov ie. And imagine the movie begins now. And you're the hero of the movie. Yeah. What would that guy do ? Yeah. What would that guy do right now? Yeah. Because you are. I just got into business. So actually, I j ust made the investment in school. And I was talking to Sam, the founder, and I said, what? Sim. Sam? Si m. What's Sim? Sim. That's why he says he's on the phone. Oh, yeah. And I was talking to him and I said, I want to give you the single easiest razor to predict my behavior. And I said, whatever will be the most e pic story is the thing that I will most likely do. And so oftentimes, the most epic story is not the shortest outcome to victory. It's the long saga that results in this big thing later eventually. And I was like, if you e ver want to know, if you're like, I'm not sure what he's going to do in this situation, just wonder what th e most epic story to tell would be. And that's usually what I will do. And I don't know if that's self-aggran dizing, but that's genuinely my razor for even making the big decisions about, okay, I'm going to sell gym watch. I'm going to marry Layla. I'm going to slum it and live at the gym. I'm going to fly around and do t urnarounds. I'm going to start this whole idea of a media company that just gives exclusively. They're lik e, how do I put all these together? It's like, well, what would be the most epic story? And I thought of thi s idea of just like, when I think about who that story I want to tell is, is this billionaire that documented t he entire thing the whole way and just gave? Because I always thought I was like, I wish that Elon Musk a nd Warren Buffett and all these guys would have liked and Jeff Bezos would have just like, I would love t o have seen 1997 Amazon content. And a lot of the content in terms of like, it's getting five views. It's lik e, it's okay because when we make it, they're going to come back and watch this. So I don't need them t o watch it today. I want them to know that it's here when I do. And I think that got me out of the loop of it. I have to win right now. And then every one of them is just dropping a kernel or breadcrumb for futur e me to refer back to. Until you win, effort always goes unnoticed. Get used to it. No one roots for you u ntil everyone roots for you. That's just how it works. Yeah. People only root for those who don't need to be rooted for it. It's strange to think about how mimetic and fallible everyone, me and you, everybody th at's listening to this is. There's stuff that I've said on this podcast for like six years since the first time that I ever said it, seven years. And it's only been within the last 18 months that it's gone viral. It's the same s entence, the exact same sentence said into the same microphone, slightly nicer lighting. And in some wa ys it's reassuring because you go, I fucking knew that was right. I knew that thing that I was saying was ri ght. And I kept saying it until people realized that it was right. Another part of it is the medium matters more than the message in many ways. The frame matters more than the picture. I would say that the m edium and the message are inextricably linked. Like if Elon Musk tweets, I'm taking a shit, it will get a zilli on shares because he's the richest man on earth and has done more entrepreneurial endeavors that hav e pushed humanity, I think more than anyone else at this point. And so like you can't separate the messa ge from the messenger. And I remember when I was in middle school, I learned this lesson where I was i n Spanish class and there was, you know, there was the class clown or whatever. And I was like, I want p eople to laugh at my jokes. And so I made a joke that was a joke that that guy probably would have mad e. And it was a self-deprecating joke. But the thing is, is that like that guy was kind of a bum and like him making self-deprecating jokes made sense because of the context of who he was. But I was a straight A s tudent who was really good at sports and no one thought it was funny. And fast forward, you know, 10 y ears, there was a joke that I had in our fraternity, which is there's nothing funny about an in shape body. And so like the, I agree with you and that the message, the medium of the message matters. And so peo ple won't root for you because we use the delivery mechanism usually as a filter for whether we should even trust the source. And so I tell the story of the teacher who's talking about dollar cost averaging into the S and P and giving investing advice. Like they might be like, man, like I give better investing advice th an Warren Buffett does. Like he's saying the same thing as me. It's like, and you know what, you're prob ably right. The only problem is you didn't build Berkshire Hathaway. And so no one gives a shit. And so t he thing is, is that we use someone's evidence and authority as a filter for how little we need to process the information. Because if you're listening to a teacher, you have to then think, okay, can I separate the message from the person? Can I independently analyze this and say, is it good? Is it bad? If Warren Buffe tt says you should buy this, you don't need to analyze it. You figure he knows more than me. He has mor e perspective and I will just take it as fact. And so it's actually lazy consumption on behalf of everyone els e that gives authority so much resonance and so much shareability because they're also protected becau se if you share something Elon says, you're protected by Elon and his brand. And so the hard work is gett ing to the point where you have the evidence that people are willing to feel safe agreeing with you. And the only way for them to feel safe agreeing with you is for you to disagree with them for a very long peri od of time until you prove that you're right. Rory Sutherland's got an idea where he says no one gets fire d for hiring KPMG. Yeah, such a good line. And it's true, people would sooner fail by following a blueprin t that's been done before than risk succeeding by trying something new. Because if you try the new thin g, any failure is on your shoulders. If you follow the blueprint, even if it's been total dog shit the last 10 ti mes that you tried it, but we followed the blueprint. We did the thing that was the same before. Michael Malice, like personal, literal professional internet troll told me when we were one of the first times that we met, I wouldn't be able to say one 10th of the shit that I can if I was taller than five foot seven. He's li ke a small guy, but he can get away with being kind of like the low key of politics on Twitter. Because if h e's six foot five and built like Alan Richard, it's going to seem like he's bullying. But there's something fun ny about him like, you know, dip, dip, dipping away. There's also something like until you win effort alwa ys goes unnoticed. I realized this with, and it made me like a little dispirited how fallible people are arou nd success. So do you remember Billy McFarland guy that did fire festival festival at Pablo Escobar's Islan d and then everyone got stranded and nearly died. If he'd been able to pull off an even remotely passabl e event, people would have hailed him as a marketing genius. Regardless of the fact that he was continu ally flying back to New York to raise money in an unethical way for a project that he didn't know if it was going to work and all the rest of this stuff. So literally the line between charlatan grifter who's out of his depth and visionary pioneer who makes things work when no one else believes that they can is just outc ome. Everyone thinks you're crazy until it works. And so I mean, if, if you think of, of the outcome as the Trump card, then all of the pain and suffering that you lead up to that point, if you're just, I think of an a ppropriate saying, I was gonna say balls deep certain that no matter what you will die or you will get the re, then the likelihood that all of the things that you've done up to that point will then be justified in retr ospect is super high. And I actually see that as super compelling as a thing to latch onto in harder times. Yes, but the ends justifying the means is a slippery slope. I'm a Machiavellian guy. So have you seen, spe aking of that, and you mentioned Robert Greene earlier on, you should buy the 25th anniversary edition of 48 laws of power, which just came out last year. Leather bound, golden boss. I have. Oh, you got it. A nd you've seen the thing on the edges. Yeah. This face is very cool. Machiavelli. The best. The, the- Super Bowl printing. Dude. So the people that don't know, you remember you would get those things in packet s of cereal when you were a kid and you could sort of move a little bit of plastic from left to right and it would look like a football player was running or something like that. It's basically the same but on the ed ge of a book. If it's flat, it's just gold foil. If you open it one way so that the pages splay out, it's Robert Gr eene's face. And if you open it so the pages splay out in the other way, it's Machiavelli's face. The fuckin g coolest book. Just, and I've seen a lot of influencer gifting of books is a big deal at the moment. You kn ow, you send the book out and maybe they'll post about it and it'll help with sales or whatever. And ther e's some very elaborate ways. I'm sure that you've received some of these. Um, cause I know that you're on the same mailing list. There's some of these that are super, super elaborate. And I remember being li ke, Oh, that was like, I don't know, like cool or whatever, but that Robert Greene book, as soon as I saw t hat it did that and I'm sending a fucking video of this to anyone that I can, this is like magic. So yeah, wha t is it? You're doing sales because you sucked at marketing. You're doing marketing cause you sucked at product. That's a great novel. Yeah, it's so funny cause, um, like with the book launch, I, I, I didn't do any of that. Um, I just always, I wanted people, I want people to read the book. Cause like if someone posts about the book before the book's out, then like, I wanted no one to have read the book until the day it was out, you know? Um, but yeah, I'm the longer I've been in at least the business game. And we were t alking about legendary foods. Um, it's just product. Like I had a roommate way back in the day who's no w a really successful entrepreneur and we were both like early days, poor as shit. Um, we happen to live together and he read this book. He just told me the title and it's like stuck with me. He said too good to f ail. And I just love that as a frame. It's like, if I open a sandwich shop, how can I make the sandwiches too good? Like just if someone takes a bite, they're like, fuck, this is the best sandwich I've ever had. Like if y ou just get that, then the rest of it doesn't matter. And so when you're like, I mean, I think about this in business decisions, but probably also in life decisions is I think Tim Ferriss talks about this, the one big do mino. It's like, what is the one thing that if I just get this one thing right, everything else shrinks into a rel evance. And I think about that from like the hero story of what you said with Joe Rogan, which I love tha t frame. It's like, okay, boom, now you're present in your movie. What would that guy do? It's like, well, what one big thing could that guy accomplish that would make all of the, all of the mediocrity of your lif e up to this point are relevant? And why are you not putting every single ounce of your effort to prove t hat one point so that you could then justify everything up to that point. So it wouldn't have been medioc rity. It would have been the path to get there. Exactly. Thank you. It would have been the journey. Peopl e want to find their passion, but you don't find it. You create it and you create it by getting good at some thing. And to get good at stuff, you start by doing something you suck at. Then you get good. Then you li ke it. Then people ask how you found your passion answer by starting when you sucked and not giving u p. Yeah, I hate the passion mantra. I really do. I mean, part of it was because I'll even, I'll even play it out. So I, I read all the same self-help books early on when I was, you know, in my entrepreneurial days and I was trying to find my passion and I was into fitness. And so I was deciding between fitness test prep, bec ause I was good at test prep. And frozen yogurt, because I like dessert, right? So I've like, these are my t hree quote passions, which let's just translate that into things you're interested in. And so as soon as I st arted the gym, my passion disappeared. It became work. And I had a different mentor later in my life wh o said, never create work around your passion because then it'll become work. And he was a guy who's a very successful business guy. And I think about that actually more than I, than I share. Because it's just complete and utter bullshit because it assumes that what you're going to be doing every day is the thing that you're currently really interested, which also doesn't make you money. And so your behavior has to change. And whenever you're doing these new things, one, they'll be new, which means you will suck at them, which means you'll probably not like them, but it's also part of it. And so like, I would prefer to tak e the extreme opposite position of everything will suck. And eventually you will get good at the things th at you suck at. And then you'll enjoy being competent at that thing, which will then probably give you st atus and you'll enjoy the fruits of status more than the pain of doing the thing. And insert doing create a positive feedback loop that you'll actually keep sticking with it. And so I'd rather set the expectation that everything is terrible all the time forever. Now let's see if we can make our, now let's see if we can beco me the person who can still do it anyways and start that as the baseline rather than trying to assume tha t I need perfect conditions in order to start. Because I mean, starting is the perfect condition. Like whate ver condition that you're in that you start was the perfect condition. There is such a thing as intrinsic mo tivation though, as well as extrinsic. You can do something, there's a whole myriad of things that you co uld be potentially good at. There's a whole myriad of things that you could be potentially good at. And m any of them could give you renown and money and social clout and that feedback loop. But there are so me that you will enjoy doing for the sake of doing them more. I don't disagree. I remember a note that I wrote to myself when I first started the podcast and I decided to turn pro with it, which is one way to tur n something you love into a labour is to monetize it. Okay. Because as soon as you decide that you're goi ng to really, really go for this, if you want to turn pro at something, I use this example in my live show of a pickleball player. So this guy loves playing pickleball and he gets to turn up on a Saturday and play with his friends. Yeah. You know, if it's cold outside, he doesn't need to go and play. And if he's tired, he does n't need to go and play. And if he's hungover, he doesn't need to go and play. And then he decides to tur n pro and he thinks I'm turning pro at this thing that I love. I can't wait to make what I love into my caree r. But he doesn't realize that, Hey, guess what? If you're hungover, you still need to go and train. I actuall y know you don't get to be hungover anymore because the guy that isn't hungover is the guy that's train ing better. So you now need to stop going out with your friends and you need to train when it's cold and you need to work on game tape and mindset and hydration and nutrition. You need to do SNC and you n eed to have a physio and you need to not see a family as much. All of these things came along for the rid e. As soon as you decided to turn pro, is that a price that you're prepared to pay? And that's an interesti ng question to ask yourself. Am I prepared to sacrifice my pure, unencumbered, unmolested love for this thing in order to try and become the best at this thing? I think it's really tough and I'm going to shoot my own advice right now in the head, or at least my positioning right now, which is that it's very easy for so meone in my position or in your position to say this is kind of what it takes. Or rather, this is like you sho uld find your passion because transparently what I do now every day, I actually really do love. I live more or less the same day, seven days a week. I'll tell you what it is just so we can have context. But I wake up and then I go to my office here and I work for six hours writing my next book. And then I take two hoursish of calls typically. And then after that, I lift in the gym that I custom designed with all the pieces that I l ove. And then I go and eat with my wife. And then I go to my condo and I sit in my recliner that overlook s the entire city. And I read, and then I go to bed. And I do that every day. And I love every aspect of the day with the exception of maybe the two hours of calls that I have to take. But I see those as a necessary thing for everything else that I have there. Now, could I stop doing that? Maybe. But for me to say that t hat's what your day needs to look like in order to get into the top floor with the view that looks over the se things. And so that you can not make money for two years while you write a book that eventually ma kes money or whatever is not true. And so it's the difference between oh, I should fly private because th at's what rich people do. I should play basketball because I want to be tall and modeling the behavior at the top of the mountain rather than the climb. And so they're completely different. And so this whole id ea, unfortunately, and I don't blame the people who do this, is they see their current life. I would see mi ne and say, well, what do I do now? I do everything that I love. Okay. But I didn't get here doing everythi ng that I love. I did a fuck load of shit I hate. And I did it for a very long period of time. And I did not have anyone to root me on. And in fact, I had many people who were actively trying to destroy my path and t ell me why it was a terrible idea. I had this idea about why you should stop taking advice from successful people. Because most of their advice is not about what they did when they were at your stage. It's about what they do now. And it's the same thing around pushing work-life balance. What I found after 50 year s at Disney is that really the most important thing is what, all right, well, how did you get to this stage? What did you do when you were two years in? Because that's where I am. Yeah. What did you do when you were broken living on the gym floor? Because that's where I am. Don't tell me about the complicate d routine or the balance or the flying private. The bar stool is upside down and you're mixing up the end s for the means. Everything on my ride up. I remember in a lot of excruciating detail what it took me to g et here. But I will say that I had a ruthless focus on dollars per hour. And so I'm just giving tactical advice right now. But everything that I could trade away for more time doing the thing that made me money w as what I did. And so I remember the first time I made a $500 sale and it took me 30 minutes. And I was l ike, every hour of every day, this is what I'm going to do. And anything that is not talking to someone in exchange for them giving me a credit card so that I can charge it and make $500, anything that makes m e less than $250 per hour or per 30 minutes, I'm giving to somebody else. And so after that first sale, I w as like, I'm never cooking again. I'm never going grocery shopping again. I'm not cleaning again. Because I knew that in one sale, I could pay for that person for the month. And so the ruthless focus on what can I do that creates an input to output being money equation. And at least for me, it was pouring everythin g I possibly could into the input and eliminating everything else. I made this video on Facebook before I was quote Alex Ramozzi years ago, when I still had six gyms before I even did the turnarounds. And I ma de this video almost as documentation, but I said, so I want to open up my seventh, eighth, ninth and 10 th location and I have the spots picked out. And I'm already working all of the hours that I'm awake. And I've already given up Saturdays. So the only thing that I have left is like Sundays and evenings. And so I a m no longer going to be watching any football, and I'm no longer going to have Netflix at all. And that is what I'm giving up for seven, eight, nine and 10. And I'm just making this video of like, that's what I'm sa crificing. And I think a lot of people create these to do lists when in my experience, it's been so much mo re useful to write down all the things that I'm willing to sacrifice. Because if you sacrifice everything, ther e's nothing left than to do the one thing that matters. And I think Jerry Seinfeld talks about this from a w riting perspective. He says that every day, no matter what he sits down and he writes for two hours. No w he doesn't have to write, but he's not allowed to do anything else. And so he can sit there, but there's nothing else to do except for write jokes. And so I think a lot about that from the client perspective, whic h is like most of everyone who's listening to this, who isn't achieving what they want is fucked with their time. They think that they're spending all their time working, but your output, like you don't even know how to work. I'm being really real with you. Like you think you know how to work, you don't know how t o work. Like the amount of output, like, and I'll measure this by like, what is your output? It's probably n ot as high as you think. And so rather than trying to learn all these productivity hacks, the ultimate prod uctivity hack is no. N-O is you stop doing shit. And then when you create space, then you can fill it with t he thing that matters, but trying to add on more to your schedule of all the things that you're not willing to sacrifice is the very reason that you're not doing what you need to do. A lot of people would look at t hat life of I'm going to sacrifice evenings and I'm not going to watch football anymore and say, well, wha t's the point? If you make yourself miserable on route to achieving the goal, if most of your life is journe y, not destination, and it makes you miserable on route to it, why do that? So that was the thing I was m entioning earlier where it's like, let's take the absolute extreme of it's going to suck and it's going to last forever. How can I be okay in that circumstance? And I do have the fundamental belief that circumstanc es nothing to do with how what your subjective wellbeing is. And so if monks can be super chill in where ver monks do monk things and have nothing and have higher subjective wellbeing ratings than anyone e lse here in the Western world, it clearly isn't external. And so then if I'm going to be just as miserable bei ng mediocre as I am doing this shit that's going to amount to something, then I might as well do the shit that's going to amount to something and be miserable there and at least have something to show for it. There's this story I learned about Victor Hugo, famous writer from history. Do you know this about what you did with this servant? So Victor Hugo needed to make himself right. So he paid his servant each nigh t during the middle of the night to come into his bedroom and remove the bed clothes from him, turn th e heating off, and then lock his bedroom door from the outside. And he wasn't allowed to leave until Vic tor slid six pages of handwritten work underneath. So you look at Opal, which is this app for iPhone, whi ch stops you from using apps or frozen turkey, cold turkey, which is the same thing for desktop. And that 's just the digital equivalent of Victor Hugo being locked in his bedroom with no bedding and just a quill and a few pieces of paper and then having a slider underneath the door. And I want to push back on so mething that you said right before Victor Hugo, which is somebody might ask, why would you do all this stuff if you're not happy? That assumes that my goal in life is to be happy. What is your goal in life? To d o epic shit. Genuinely, to be useful. And so why place do epic shit over be happy? Because when I look b ack on my life in retrospect, the things that bring me the most joy in the moment are the things that I wa s willing to sacrifice for for an extended period of time. And those pay memory dividends far greater tha n the momentary cost that I had at the moment. And so I think it's a long-term, short-term thing. But a fr ame that continued to paralyze me for a long period of time was an obsession with happiness. Like it wa s truly an obsession. It was an obsession of mine in college. I almost got into positive psychology becaus e I thought that was really interesting. That's what I, that's what I, my passion, right? I consumed all that stuff and I drove myself mad with it. And I actually was more sad and depressed than anything, which is probably why I was trying to find all this positive hippy-dippy stuff. And I just cracked one day and I was l ike, fuck happiness. Because it felt so out of reach that I was like, just fuck it. I'm just not, I'm not even, I' m not even going to shoot for it. I'm just going to do stuff. And that's all I'm going to do. I'm just going to do stuff. And what happened was like a few years later, dot, dot, dot, a few days later, um, I looked up a nd I was like, huh, I'm not miserable. And so I actually identified for a very long period of time as I'm not a happy person, comma, and that's okay. I'm fine with that. I accept that. And there was this huge confli ct for such a long period of time where I was like, you're supposed to be happy. Why aren't you happier? Like there's something wrong. There's something wrong with you. Something needs to change rather th an saying like, maybe the level of happy that you are is fine. Who am I like? What happy am I comparing myself to? And also if wherever your current state is, if you just say like happy err, which is really when p eople are like, I want to be happy, they're just saying, I want to be happy err than I am, which means tha t you create this distance between where you are and where you want to be, which is the recipe for bein g unhappy is saying that I want to be happy err. So it doesn't matter how happy you are, you want to be happy err. And so by relinquishing the desire to be happy, I ended up enjoying a lot more of the stuff tha t I was doing because I didn't make it a requisite for, for my activities. So then it became a pleasant surpr ise. I was like, oh, this doesn't suck. Huh, how nice. Two famous psychologists, Daniel Gilbert and Daniel Kahneman have quite divergent views on happiness. It's quite interesting. So Daniel Gilbert talks about h ow if you spent every minute of the rest of your life on a floaty, Lilo, in a pool drinking cocktails, in retros pect, you might not have found much meaning, but each individual moment of experience would have b een enjoyable. And he believes that constitutes to him a life that is well-lived. I disagree with this guy en tirely. Daniel Kahneman, and this is my position too, which is a well-lived life is one which in retrospect, you are glad that you lived, right? So one is leaning towards hedonic pleasure and the other is leaning to ward meaning. So one you could say is happiness and the other is meaning. It's my belief that your dispo sition largely influences where on that spectrum from Lilo to do hard things you need to sit and you will have friends. And I did for a very long time in the nightlife industry, have friends that just seem to be so f ucking happy, not doing stuff. Like just, they would float through life and they wouldn't ask themselves, am I actualizing my fucking virtue? Is this the highest integrity that I can do with these things and all the rest of it? And I was envious of those people. Have you ever seen a dog? You see a dog on the floor and i t's just lying there and you think, oh my God, if only I could be that dog. Like it just wants to go for walk a nd have food and like go pee pee. That's it. That's all it wants to do. And you think, fuck, it would be grea t to be that dog. But like, guess what? If your constitution doesn't allow you to be that dog, the only way out is through. And this was something, the first time that I went to go and see Peterson, someone aske d him a question and they said, the depth of my consciousness causes me to suffer. Is it a blessing or a c urse to feel everything so deeply? He thought for a little bit and he said, take more of the thing that pois ons you until you turn it into a tonic that girdles the world around you. The only way out is through. And it's kind of like, as soon as you realize that there are things that you do that give you satisfaction and the re are things that other people do that give them happiness and you've tried that route. The only way is to continue doing the thing that you know that works. And I think that you were an example of someone who is optimizing heavily for meaning rather than for hedonism. And that's not to say that there are peo ple, and this is, I said this on the last episode, the fundamental thing that people don't understand as far as I can tell about your worldview is that the thing that you do for work and the thing that you do for fun are the same thing. They can't imagine that because that's not the way that it is for them. And it's not m aybe the way it is for most people. But if you're the sort of person that finds meaning more enjoyable th an happiness, you need to optimize for the thing that you enjoy the most. And I'll toss in, and meaning la sts longer. And so I'll be super upfront. If those friends of yours in the nightlife, there's nothing wrong wi th that in my way, like as I see the world. If that's you and you're like, I fucking love everything I do, then you won. Just keep doing that, you know what I mean? But I think a lot of the message that Chris and I a re saying here is that if you've tried that path and it hasn't worked for you, then you have this dark door that's in the corner that you've been trying all the other ones that have nice gold edges and really shiny t hings. But there's that door that you keep looking at. And it's the other side of you that's clearing us thro ugh it in the other room. And it's like, you just have to bust through the door. And I think that the, like gi ving yourself permission to be unhappy, or at least for me, giving myself permission to be unhappy for a n extended period of time in order to get what I wanted, gave me so much relief from, honestly, I don't l ike using the word nowadays because it has so many associations, but just from like the depression or th e funk that I was in for a few years. Yeah, I just didn't like my life. And I had achieved by most measures, because I don't have the, you know, school failed me, I was a whatever, like I wasn't that. I finished in th ree years and I did really well in school and I had a really good job. But it was empty for me. And so my g oal is things we talked about earlier, but my personal goal is to squeeze every ounce of potential out of whatever I have. And I think that if you feel like you have potential left over, then it will eat you alive unt il you do something about it. Not to piss off the positive polys in the room. But if you haven't gotten wha t you want, then you're not worthy of it, period. And that's okay. Now you can admit that you suck and i mprove. Better to know you're bad for a season than pretend you're good for a lifetime. You're not maki ng as much money as you want, because you're not as good as you think you are. You're not struggling fr om imposter syndrome. You're a student and pretending to be a teacher. No students say they feel like f rauds for trying to learn. You're a fraud when you get up to teach the class and you've never done it. De ep. I think it's just giving yourself permission to suck. It's giving yourself permission to be unhappy. It's gi ving yourself permission to not achieve what you do for a long period of time. It's giving yourself permiss ion to lose friends. It's giving yourself permission to do things that's different than people in your social c ircle or your age group are doing. It's giving you permission, giving yourself permission to be an exceptio n so that you can become exceptional. And a lot of that, the whole positive poly mantra of like that, I sa w that, I saw a post a girl made and she was like, you are worthy. And that's what made that tweet. All my tweets are just responses to should I say. And so this girl was like, I say this to myself in the morning, like you are worthy, you are amazing, you are a goddess. And I was like, you're not a goddess because yo u don't control me. And you don't have the things that you want. You keep thinking that you saying that you're worthy is going to somehow make it true. But like the way that you know, you're worthy is that y ou have it. That's it. Like that is the litmus test. Are you worthy of a billion dollars? Well, are you a billion aire? No, then you're not worthy. And so just like, I think we have these things. It's just like, you're unbal anced. It's like, you're not worthy. There's these things that were programmed to say, oh, that's bad. Yo u have to tell everyone they're worthy. You're everyone's beautiful. No, if everyone are beautiful, then n o one's beautiful. And yet again, we're back at square one. And so it's, it's, I guess, drinking the tonic. It's , it's going through the shit, which is honestly the boring stuff that no one wants to do for an extended p eriod of time. And accepting that you suck and that it is okay because the first step is accepting that you stuck, you suck so that you can do the second step, which is doing something about it. What about you'r e not making as much money as you want because you're not as good as you think you are. That's, I mea n, I'm obviously in the business space and that follows up with the other one with the imposter syndrom e. People are like, man, how do you not suffer from imposter syndrome? I was like, because I've done w hat I said I've done. And the people who get up on stage and try and teach a class and shit they haven't d one. It's like that, like you feel like an imposter when you're an imposter, like don't try and kill that voice, listen to that voice and get the evidence to make that voice shut the fuck up. Like if I get on stage and I s ay I can bench 315, is there like, do I feel like an imposter when I say that? No, I stay fact. And presumabl y if you're pioneering and breaking new ground, you just put the biggest investments that you ever did i nto this new thing. That is a new level that you get to. And that's one that's to do with finance, but there could be another one that's to do with capacity or competence. You could be sitting down in a room doi ng a deal, which is time bound in a way that it's never been before, or is in an industry only tangential to one that you've been in before. Each time that you do something new, by definition, you're an imposter because you haven't done it before. Now, if you're teaching, that's different. But if you're growing suffici ently quickly, most of the time it's fresh snow. So this is a topic I love, but I think the difference between doing something new and being an imposter is one is pretending to be something that they're not. So I made the biggest investment in school. I'm making a bet that I think communities are going to be huge. And I think that there's a ton of people who want to teach skills they have in communities, et cetera, an d school.com can help. But it would only be an imposter if I said, I guarantee it, no matter what, this is g oing to be the biggest thing ever. And one of the big things that I repeat from the marketing front, I say a ll the time, I say, state the facts and tell the truth. The best marketing in the entire world is truth. Now, if the truth isn't compelling, it doesn't mean you lie. It means you change the world to make the facts com pelling. As in, if I say, man, I want to be like, you see this one all the time, 18 year olds are like, I want to be a motivational speaker. And say, okay, well, what are your facts? You've done nothing. Great. So they then lie so that they can try and claim success that they don't deserve so they can get authority that the y can't back up and eventually are called out and are flattened. To be fair, they only impress people who don't know anything anyways. So if they're honest about it, they look at their fact sheet and say, what w ould a motivational speaker have to have in order for them to have authority? And then that becomes y our action list of what you need to do. And then once those facts are the truth, then you can state the fa cts and tell the truth. And then people will be like, wow, that's so motivational. But all you did was tell th e truth. And so like, that is why I so wholeheartedly rejected one, like you are worthy, you're not worthy. If you had it, then you wouldn't even need to say you were worthy because you'd already fucking have it . And if you were in like, I struggle with imposter syndrome. Why you only struggle imposter syndrome b ecause you're fucking lying. Like, that's why you feel like an imposter. And now they're like, why didn't t he thing is is you can fudge the truth. Like you can, you can not lie is very different than telling the truth. Like I can make something seem a certain way without deliberately breaking the law, but I'll know. And t hat's why you feel like an imposter because you fucking know. And there's the guy in the other room is c learing his throat be like, that's not fucking true. And then that discord. But if you just say what you have done, or you say what you are doing, I'm making this big investment. It's a big bet for me. The reason I'm making this bet is because I see this trend and I think it's a good idea. I could be fucking wrong. But I'm n ot going to feel like an imposter because of it. Because that's the truth. Thinking about the community t hing, I had a conversation a little while ago, I don't, I don't think that you're, that you're far off wrong, es pecially in an age of automation. This guy made a really great point, which you probably thought of, whi ch is one of the very few things that you can't automate is community. Can AI community? No. What yo u're going to have, I mean, maybe, maybe. A zillion bots in a. Yeah, exactly. One guy, one guy and a thou sand bots that are all doing it. Maybe GPT 10 can do that or whatever. But the next, this interquartile pe riod, whatever we're coming up to, is the easiest way to, to hedge against automation, I think, is to focus on community. All right, next one. If you can be in a bad mood for no reason, you might as well be in a g ood mood for no reason. If it's not going to change your life, it shouldn't change your mood. If the cost is peace of mind, don't buy it. Yeah. If you can be in a bad mood for no reason, then you can be in a good mood for no reason, which means that if you can do something that's amazing and still have a shit day, i t means you can do something that sucks and have a good day, which means the entire excuse around, I don't want to do all these hard things because as a proxy, it makes my mood sad is ridiculous because it means that we are ultimately in control of how we want to perceive the work that we do. And so I think that is ultimately the most freeing thing that you can do in terms of how you can equip yourself to get th rough those harder periods. Why do you think there's so much cynicism at the moment, especially on th e internet? It's easier. You can always defend no. Like we actually do with this a lot at acquisition.com fr om an investment perspective. And we actually have to check ourselves, which is it's always easy to find a reason not to do an investment. So we have a no bias and you should have it. I mean, you should overa ll have a no bias. Like you should say, okay, here's all the things that could go wrong. And you have to kin d of think that way because you have to manage risk. But if you say no to everything, you're always right in the short term, but if you never make an investment, you're wrong in the one way that matters, whic h is you get no return. And so like you always miss the short term losses, but you lose the big long-term gain. And so it's, again, this is a continuum to be managed more than a problem to be solved, but cynicis m is short term. It's like every, so when you, so, okay, this is, so when you go home, right? And you want to start a new business or you have a girl that you're bringing back and your friends and your family are l ike, she's not going to last or like, this isn't going to, this isn't going to be forever. They are right. Literally every single time, except for the one time you bring your wife home. And in that time they're all wrong. And it's the one time that fucking matters. And so the idea that, but the thing is, is because of the false p ositives or the true positives, they might've been right literally 19 out of 20 times. And if they were right the first time and the second time and the third time and the fourth time, why would they bet against n o on the fifth time or the 50th time? But you only need one yes or one positive to change your entire life . And so there's this habit and that's where cynicism comes from where we get so many positive reinforc ers for saying no and being right. But it's only short-term being right because you have to make big bets to win big. And that also means that you're wrong plenty of times and people aren't willing to look stupi d for being wrong. This school bet could go wrong. I'm betting it's not, but everything has risk and I've be en public about it. And so like, if anything, but like I've played this out. So like, I'll tell you how I played th is out. I was like, if it goes wrong, I'll document the things that I learned and then I'll apply next time and I'll do what I've always done. State the facts and tell the truth. It is strange to think about how being cyni cal or skeptical or kind of sardonic or cutting or a luff. It's used as a proxy for being smart. The worst thin g that anybody could be accused of is naive. That's what they're trying to optimize against. They don't w ant to be seen as naive. Oh, you can't fucking, you hope that everything was going to be good. Oh, that's , I mean, that's cute. Like, you know, the world will teach you, it'll, don't worry, don't worry. It's like, it'll, it'll, you'll learn, you'll learn. People don't want to be naive. And they'll be right. And that's what's, that's what's painful is that it takes more effort to start in the beginning and more people are right about the f act they're like, Hey, you're not going to hit it big. And guess what? A month in, you're not, but they're o nly measuring on months and it's six months. You're also not going to have hit it big yet. And they're goi ng to be like, I'm still fucking right. And at a year, you're still not going to hit it big and they'll still be fucki ng right. And every day that you haven't hit it, they're going to feel like they were right. But they're wron g because they're measuring in days and you're measuring in decades. There's this idea from Gwinder ca lled the cynical genius illusion. Cynical people are seen to be smarter, but sizable research suggests they actually tend to be dumber. Cynicism is not a sign of intelligence, but a substitute for it, a way to shield o neself from betrayal and disappointment without having to actually think. There was a, there's a tweet o n a doomsday money Twitter guy. And he said, uh, yeah, he's predicted a 16 out of the last three recessi ons. And the thing is, is that no one, no one recalls the other 13 times that guy was wrong and they don' t recall all of the gains that probably were made in the marketplace by people who didn't sell during that time period. There was this, uh, broad, you know, people forwards shit on WhatsApp. And if it's been for ward lots of times, it even says at the top forwarded many times. It's like a little warning. And this happe ned, I think around, uh, COVID there was an image of one guy, one squaddie wearing army gear walking through the streets of London. And this was forwarded on WhatsApp as evidence that the army was goi ng to come and hold people in the house at gunpoint. And if you left, it was going to be martial law was going to be deployed on the streets of London. And this went fucking nuclear, completely interstellar, ab solutely everywhere. What happened with that? What happened with what happened with that thing? Not a single person who decided to spout this half-baked opinion that never turned out to be true ever g ot held to account for that. And I must have received that message like five times. Yeah. Like, Hey, you d on't get to just make these like ridiculous, like actually stupid fucking claims about the world. And then n o one called you to account. I'm going to hit on the cynicism point. Um, the world belongs to optimists b ecause if you're going to do anything big, you have to believe that it can happen. Otherwise it never will. That Sean Puri thing, the cynics get to be right. And the optimists get to be rich. Yeah. Like if you look at i t from a percentage of success rate, I've been wrong more times than I've been right. I have failed more times than I've succeeded, but you always succeed more and to write more in the big ways than the peo ple who've been right all along and are wrong. Trevor says this, my, my editor, he says, uh, 99% right an d 100% wrong. So like they're, they're right 99% of the time, but they're wrong a hundred percent becau se the only thing that matters is the big one at the end. Like your family and friends will say that every gi rl that you ever date is not good enough, except for the one time you find the girl that you're actually goi ng to marry. And then it doesn't matter. Or like this won't last or like this business idea, it's not going to work. And you might have nine failures. I feel my first nine businesses didn't really amount to anything. Nine, nine as in the first one spent time, fucking failed. Second one, this one will be different. Fucking fai led. Third one, this one, this is the one and then seven, six more after that, right? I'm just painting this pi cture because like it's painful as shit because the whole time everyone is telling you, I told you so. And th ey're right today, but not forever. If the cost is peace of mind, don't buy it. Why? I use the peace of mind as a, as a indicator for breach in values. So that's the, I want to become known rather than, and sacrifice my reputation in order to do so. And so for me, I would lose peace of mind, like right on the edge. I'm lik e, I don't know, this is a little bit edgy. I had a guy who shared a bash clip of me and somebody like took my clip and then was like, this is wrong. And so I looked at the guy's profile and I saw he was a VC and I was like, huh, okay. I know who this is. Oh, and so I DMed him and I was like, do you disagree with this? And he said something and then I just eviscerated him. And he was like, you're right. I overstepped beca use I wanted to try and do a viral clip. You are fundamentally right. And I was wrong. And so like that is what I would never want to be. Like that is disgusting to me. And so the cost of making a viral clip to try and trend jump when I know that fundamentally the thing isn't right is not worth the price. There's a, thi s shows up in, in other ways. So I had it. What the fuck did I do? I, I think I tried to throw a used Splendor packet in a bin in a restaurant. You know, like, yeah, did that. But I was leaving and I was like, it's next to the bin. Someone will get it. And I walked 30 yards away. Fuck. Turned around, went back, put it in the b in. Yeah. You'd know. That's the peace of mind. Yeah. And this is another one of those interesting refram es. This is really, really interesting to me. If the cost is peace of mind, don't buy it. You can see, and I did for a long time, my inability to move in as ruthless of a way as I, as other people do as a weakness, as a v ulnerability. And I realized in retrospect that it's just a higher standard that I'm holding myself to. And th at can be, that will result in many times me doing things that, and, and, and having things that I need to overcome. I'm working on my people pleasing tendencies as hard as I can at the moment to not, to not, yeah. I, I end up, I don't like to disappoint people. I don't like to do things that causes other people to fe el bad or feel hurt or to tell them things that they don't want to hear. That's why that Dr. Robert Glover, the No More Mr. Nice Guy was just so fucking, like very, very, very incisive. But I realized even with that, I had to add a conversation with a friend and it's to do with this book. And there's a bunch of ideas that everybody's been working on in my friend group for quite a while. And I was like, I really want to write a bout this thing and send him a long, overly arduous voice note explaining about how conflicted I was bec ause it's not my idea. Now no one owns the truth. That's one of the brilliant things about working throug h quotes and things like this is no one owns it, right? Like if it's accurate, nobody gets to own the truth. It 's just an insight about the way that reality exists. So I sent him this big long voice note and he replied to me and said, and I, in it, I'm over pattern matching a lot of the things I'm doing as people pleasing. Like it 's the, I think I sent you that tweet about, I just learned about the recency bias and of all of them, I have to say it's my favorite one. So you see this new thing and it's the hot new toy that you're playing with or whatever, the like shiny new toy. And he responded and he said, I wanted to say how grateful I am that you in amongst all of the stuff and the book and the show and all of the different people pulling on your attention, that the first place that you would go to and thinking about this idea is how I would feel rathe r than how you can like wheedle it so that you get the outcome that you want or whatever. I would be v ery hesitant in you saying, are you calling that people pleasing when it's one of the reasons that I love yo u as a friend? I was like, huh, that's interesting. That's a reframe that I hadn't anticipated. And that is aga in the peace of mind thing. Now your level for peace of mind may be different to somebody else's, but I don't think that that's something that you should be ashamed of. You know, as a fun challenge for anyon e who's listening, try telling the truth in social settings. So when someone invites you to a party, instead of coming up with a fake excuse that you both know is a fake excuse, just say, I don't want to go. Really f uck with you. And if someone like says, Hey, can you, you know, help me move? You're like, I don't want to. It's very freeing because the thing is, is that like their response is on them. And if I just, I try and anch or myself to truth, if I just tell the truth and state the facts, I'm good with me. And if someone, and I aske d them, cause I had an exchange recently where I said that, um, I say it often and now people who are ar ound me are accustomed to the fact that I will just state the facts and tell the truth. Um, I said, would yo u have preferred that I lied to you? And the guy just, I was like, so you would prefer that I lie. I will not b e associated with someone who would prefer that I lied to them because it makes my life difficult becau se then I'd have to lie, which then would breach one of my, my values. So in the future, you know, I had someone who, um, recently was like, Hey, um, Hey, if you need anything, you know, let me know how I c an help. I'd be like, you don't mean that. Because if I actually need something, you will not help. And so i t's, it's really uncomfortable for a lot of people because it breaks a lot of social norms. But I think that lea rn it's kind of like the hundred knows is like being comfortable, like it's just being comfortable with the tr uth. And the truth is one of the scariest, ugliest things, you know, like, why don't you want to go to anot her day with me? I don't like you. You're not worthy. But like people are so uncomfortable with that. An d I think that the, the, I've just tried to shed bullshit as much as I could for my life. And it's just made thin king a lot easier and also dealing with relationships a lot easier because you also by shedding social nicet ies, when you do also state the truth, when I say, I think you fucking killed that people know it fucking ca rries weight because you don't just say that. And so I would say most of my team, for example, if I pay a compliment, they know that I mean it. And I don't have to say like, Hey, like if I'm being honest, I really f eel like I don't have to, I don't like, and it makes your words mean what you say. And I think that is like, I, I aspire to be a man who, when I say things, people know that I mean them. And I think a way to do that is to stop saying things that I don't mean. And so I'm trying to cut as much of the words that are niceties and things that I don't mean, and are nonsensical and bullshit that I've been taught to say in this social si tuation, when someone says that makes sense, I say, no, it doesn't make any sense. People are like, Oh, um, because when, when someone says make sense at the end of a sentence, we are trained to just nod and say, yeah, yeah, even though if you didn't even process it, but if I don't think it makes sense, I say, n o, I don't think it makes sense. Or no, I don't understand. And again, you don't want to look stupid, but l ooking stupid in the moment so that you can better understand something makes you not look stupid fo r the rest of your life. When you actually understand it. And so I've just, that has been a huge effort of m ine is to make, make words great again. Um, make words mean what they mean again. Yeah. And I, and I , and I really, I, I sparred with that with my writing and especially in my social relationship because time i s so valuable and we have so, so little of it. And I don't want to waste any of it pretending to be someon e or say things that I don't mean. It's normal to not know what you're doing. If you did, it wouldn't be cal led growth. High five your fear, uncertainty and doubt and carry on. Do you get tired, stressed, sad, hun gry, frustrated, unfocused? Do you feel misunderstood? Great. You're human. You don't need medicatio n. I have a huge vehement distaste for, uh, mental medication. And I think one is because it's overprescri bed to, because people over WebMD themselves and fundamentally people find a problem with being h uman. And I think a lot of that is because of the social norm that we should be never hungry, never sad, never angry, never frustrated, never feel like we're misunderstood. And those are the, those are the tro ughs and peaks of humanity. And we can't only wish for sunny days because otherwise we'd have droug hts and no one would, everyone would die. And so it's wishing for something that isn't true and will nev er happen. It's wanting a lie, which is why I'm so against it. Now, are there people who they can test thei r neurology and whatever? Maybe, but like honestly, a hundred years ago, this didn't exist and people ju st dealt with life. And I think people were happier then than they are now. And so clearly this solution ha sn't been much of a solution at all. And so I, if I, you know, I'd try to have, I don't have that many extrem es to answer. Well, maybe I do, but one of my extreme stances is that there is nothing wrong with you b ecause even if there is something wrong with you, how do you benefit by saying there is something wro ng with you and then accepting that label into yourself? Because the alternative to that is accepting your current existence as maybe this is better than everyone else's. And I'm just choosing to believe that it's wrong. And all of this is around some big, mighty should that we think and that we worship, that it shoul d, that we should be a certain way that we're not. And I think that discrepancy, that word, I've tried to el iminate as much as humanly possible from my vocabulary. Cause like I shouldn't what? I should nothing according to whom? Why should I be happier? Why should I be have less anxiety? Why should I feel mor e understood? And so like pretty much the beginning of every ad for like Levitra or whatever, you know, whatever the new serotonin, you know, SSRI thing is, it's like they describe humanity. They just say like, are you hungry? Are you tired? Are you horny? Are you like, are you dissatisfied in any way? Well, the cu re of that is a pill, which I wholeheartedly decry anything that gives it if than statement for happiness. So like you will own nothing and be happy. Like you want to say that you're going to change my external co ndition to change how I feel. I just, I just reject it as a, as any kind of, if then I'll be happy. But like the pill, the over medication part, I am, I've had too many people too close to me ruin their lives, topping from S SRI SSRI and getting on cocktails of pills and they've got a sleep med and they've got a wake up med and they're just, they're just a walking pharmacy. It's crazy for people who aren't American to look at the wa y that America deals with this. I remember, so in the UK, just for context, you can't get prescribed melat onin. You can't buy it over the counter. You can't buy it on Amazon. My video guy, when he flies over he re, takes it back like some, like he fucking smuggle it. Like he's like Pablo Escobar, but with melatonin tab lets instead, like going into CVS, am I allowed to get this? That's the degree of difficulty that it is to get pr escribed anything. And in America, the first place that people term when they have a problem is the pill bottle. I mean, I have two physician parents, so like, and I would say Western, you know, for the most pa rt, Western medicine through the just belief in all pharmaceuticals and all that kind of stuff. And so I've, I grew up really close to it. My grandfather is a physician. So like just lots of medicat medicine in the famil y in general. And I, um, I just hate it. I really do. I don't hate a lot of things, but I really, I really, I hate, I ha te what it does to people and more the underlying thing is that they reject being human and they think t here's something wrong with them. And so many people waste all of their time trying to solve a problem that is life rather than living it. And it drives me nuts. Like they, they, they search for the medication rath er than confronting the problem. Like you don't have an anxiety problem. You need to deal with whatev er the thing you're worried about is. Like I mean, man, I have too many controversial beliefs. I'm getting i nto too much of it. Like you drink a lot because you're stressed. If you deal with the thing that stresses y ou, that's the trigger for you drinking. So yes, there's addictive properties to drinking. I'm not going to, I' m not denying that, but the thing that leads to the drinking, the condition that creates that, that's somet hing that you can attack. And so I think so little attention is given to accepting reality rather than saying t here's something wrong that people waste their entire lives searching for an answer that doesn't exist. What about it's normal to not know what you're doing. If you did, it wouldn't be called growth. High five your fear, uncertainty and doubt and carry on. If you knew what you were doing, then you would be sta gnating because you'd be doing nothing new. And so if you're going to do something new, then that is w hat would be the catalyst for growth. And so you can't want to grow and also want to know everything y ou're doing at the same time. It's like the two beliefs contradict one another. And so I think that's a lot o f, a lot of the discontent that people suffer from is they want two things that are polar opposites. They w ant the really strong character. They want the easy life. Like one is the price of the other. You have a har d life to have great character. You have an easy life. You have shitty character. Everything came easy. Yo u want to grow. You don't want hardship. Hardship creates growth. And so they want both and you can't like it's, it's wanting the Jordans without paying the price. They're there and the price isn't bad. It's just t he price is what it is. And so it's just, do you want the Jordans or not? And if you do the not lament the p rice tag, pay the price tag and be happy you have the Jordans. And if you don't want the Jordans, then d on't buy them. There's something in here is around comparing the lessons that people who have achieve d success tell you about how to also achieve success when they're using that pattern, which is what they look like they know what they're doing. I should look like I know what I'm doing. I should feel like I know what I'm doing. But you don't know what you're doing. You're a white belt and that person's a third degr ee black belt and whatever it is that you're trying to pursue. State the facts and tell the truth. I mean, th e amount of 900 follower Instagram accounts that all I see is people espousing advice on how to grow th eir social media following. You're never going to win. You don't get it. I've been following, you don't get i t because the content of what you're putting out, sorry, the evidence that encapsulates your message di sproves literally everything you say before you open your mouth. And the thing is, is that people are obs essing about the algorithm and this type of font, and I should do vertical format and I should do horizont al format. And I use this as an analogy that you can draw to anything, but everyone has that friend who i s a train wreck on relationships who gives relationship advice. It's just like, it doesn't even matter if the a dvice is good. You're a train wreck. It's the fat friend who gives advice on how to be fit. It's just like, and t hey're like citing all these studies and you should try these supplements. It's like, you're a fat fuck. Just s hut up. Stop. Don't waste your breath. No one is listening. And so it's just, it's missing the big obvious thi ng. And so again, it's like that big domino. You're like, I want to get into fitness. There was a friend of mi ne actually who's in the fitness space and he's like, I really want to grow my fitness business. And obviou sly I have books on it and I have videos and did that for a whole past life. And I was like, dude, you're not in shape. He's like, but I know all these, I was like, you don't look like someone that anyone wants to loo k like. And so the thing is like, for whatever you're doing, the big one thing is like, if you were, looked like a shredded God, you could say, eat fried chicken every day and people would buy your shit. Cause like, what's the one big domino that if I just did that, everything else would take care of itself. Do that. And ev ery ounce of effort you're putting into an effort, you're putting into not doing that is a waste. Basically th e V shred model. Actually really nice guys. Yeah, they're here in Vegas. He's like public enemy number o ne for the fitness pros. Yeah. What was your definition of trauma that you taught me on the phone? Oh yeah. So, because this word is so thrown around on social media, my God. I was like, okay, I have to defi ne this so that I can try and like understand it. So I believe trauma is when you have a punishing event th at permanently changes behavior. That's it. So if you, you know, are a kid and you touch the stove and y ou burn your hand and you never touch the stove again, you were traumatized. Now the thing is, is that that's a positive consequence. So is trauma bad? I don't know. Was the consequence bad in that situatio n? No. And so a lot of people use the, this person traumatized me as the, as the, the transgression. Wher eas the question is what was the result of that quote trauma? Because trauma is just accelerated learnin g. And so if you have PTSD, for example, if you were abroad and had lots of bombs going off, then you h ad rapid learning. So you have trauma that permanently changes your behavior around loud noises. And so you generalize loud noises from this environment to now when someone honks, you, you know, freak out and you think about those situations, right? And so just defining the world around me has helped m e navigate it a lot better so that I can understand what we're talking about. Cause there are so many, yo u know, trauma is a feeling in your body that you have to, you have to release the trauma. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? You don't release trauma. You change behavior due to a stimulus. That's it. And so if you want to change your behavior back, you create a new condition that reinforces the new behavior you want, period. Cause otherwise we appeal to mysticism and we just say lots of like nonsensi cal bullshit that the whole woo woo world is all about. I actually spoke at woo woo event, which was real ly funny. How did that go? Surprisingly? Well, I just started by being like, you will all disagree with most of the things I say, but they, they kind of mysticized my, my nihilism. So it worked out fine. How'd you do that? Well, because I just described actions. And so they describe those actions as attraction for whatev er. And I was like attract, propel, whatever. If you, you know, make a hundred calls, you'll have more pe ople who know who you are than if you don't. That's the same as putting out an energetic frequency to t he quantum realm. It's saying that you want money. I have no idea what any of that means. Dude, there was a podcast that I got linked to from a girl in Austin who got inducted into some weird cult that was sa crificing period blood at the full moon so that they could get Birken bags. Yeah. Austin's a weird place. S o you, you were there for a while. I was. Yeah. Well, too weird for me. Spat you up. Alex, I appreciate yo u, man. Thank you for coming on. What's next? What can people expect from you next few months? We ll, all my effort is in the school games. So we're, I mean, I can talk about them. I can not talk about them. Yeah. So yeah, so I just made the biggest investment in my life. I'm not co-owner of school.com. It's a pla tform where you can build what you want to build, learn what you want to learn, and schools will give y ou the tools, community, and the education to help you. And so we've actually created a whole thing wh ere people can start all this stuff for free, because I just, I believe my whole platform has been education . That's what I believe in. I think the education system is broken and teachers don't get paid or given the resources to actually teach students in their, you know, they're supposed to teach tests that they know don't help students. Students get educated on stuff that doesn't matter in the real world. And they go in to amounts of debt for a piece of paper that doesn't make them anything to pay off the debt that they'r e in for the rest of their lives. And I just, I hate all of it, which is why we started making the content that we do. And so this is one big investment that I'm doing to try and make my small debt towards helping fi x that. And I don't, like I obviously talk about business, that's what I know. Okay. But one person can't do that. Like I can't change, I mean, I can try, you know, but like I don't think one person's going to change t he world. And so I wanted to invest in a platform that would help other people do that for one another. And so whether it's like, you know how to paint and you want to teach me how to paint, you know how to fix Hondas and you want to teach me how to do that. Like there are so many more useful skills that w e can trade with one another. And I think Ben Franklin said, there's no more high, there's no more noble a deed than to help another no more to educate. And I wholeheartedly believe that. And so, I mean, tha t's what I'm investing my dollars in my time into. And so, yeah, that's like my whole next year. In terms o f what I'm investing, obviously, acquisition.com, we continue to invest, we're a family office. And so if yo u have a business that you want to sell or scale, you can hit us up. Hell yeah. I'm going to enjoy watching it happen, man. Appreciate you. Thanks for having me on. Thank you. Thank you very much for tuning in .
